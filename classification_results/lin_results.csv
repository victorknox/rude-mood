"It's more accurate to say you can run the same kernel+initramfs binary on most desktops, but each phone requires a different binary.

The biggest obstacle is phones lacking a unified boot / hardware detection mechanism. On desktops, booting is just MBR or UEFI, ACPI + PCIE can find most of the hardware.

On a phone you need to hard-code what is soldered to each pin of the SoC into the kernel, or at least into the initramfs. Linux can't even read its own boot media without that information, and there is no standardized accessible-on-boot data source like the ACPI table.

Baseband firmware isn't the problem here: the kernel cares more about how the baseband is connected than what runs inside it. You can plug a M.2 LTE modem on a desktop and the kernel would detect it over PCIE, then upload a binary firmware and start using it. No such luxury on a phone.",0,0.14427249476071166

"Assuming that ""to run Linux"" means ""to run free desktop OS with Linux kernel and GNU/Freedesktop userspace, being able to utilize all meaningful device functions incl. comms and camera"".
Mostly because phones don't have hardware discovery mechanisms and require that kernel has all information like memory ranges used for IO on this exact phone. On desktops there's ACPI which is basically a directory of non-auto-discoverable devices, and PCI which provides device discovery mechanism (via host-to-PCI bridge which is discovered via ACPI). On phones in theory there's DeviceTree instance passed from bootloader to kernel, but in practice it only contains few devices which the bootloader has to initialize in order to boot the kernel, and the rest has to be compiled into the kernel itself. And infinite minor differences between different phones and devices inside them make it almost impossible to create a unified kernel which would gather enough interested developers for a self-sustained process.

I also never claimed the question is invalid in any way, but this isn't [ELI5](/r/ELI5), so rather than explaining in simple terms I present facts. And the facts are:
- Linux (the Kernel) is on the majority of phones. Based on [these numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Market_share) Android, and thus the Linux kernel, has a market share of ~88%.
- Linux (the distributions) go beyond just Ubuntu, and depending on your personal definition *can* include Android (AOSP) or ChromeOS, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution#Examples). Otherwise you'd have to say that OpenWRT isn't Linux as well, as it doesn't ""behave"" like a Desktop Distro as well.
- Using a bit of effort and free (as in freedom) software you can make *almost any* Android phone look and behave just like a Desktop

> - vendors caring about linux.
You can't customize any rgb in your Pc on linux, you can't change Logitech mouse shortcuts on linux, you get the idea, we need vendors to care about linux to create utilities for linux so you can use all the features

Heh. A big reason I use the hardware I do is that everything can be configured on the hardware itself, and so doesn't need those utilities that are only available on Windows. I dislike those utilities anyway, since they don't integrate with the rest of the OS. IMO, hardware features should be able to be configured within, for example, the KDE system settings, without needing a custom utility. 

As for the rest… on my end I've avoided using these incompatible softwares in the first place because even before I switched to Linux I was moving to free software on my old MacBook, which wasn't compatible with many of these anti-cheat games in the first place either so I never had a chance to get into them.

Interesting take that I don't really see discussed on r/linux but think about very often. Here in Brazil (and I'm guessing any other country that has low wages and whose currency is at least 4 times lower than the dollar or euro) there's a particularly strong piracy culture, borderline normalized. Piracy is considered a significant factor as to why people cling to proprietary software without even thinking of alternatives, so I can see why you mention this.

I'd argue popularizing piracy on desktop Linux would hurt Linux more than benefit it though. We barely have companies that make profit on Linux selling their software as products, it's already a tiny userbase to sell your product, if people start pirating their software and decrease their sales even if just for a year that would be a strong demotivator. From what I gather piracy usually improves sales only in the long term and only if there's at least some preexisting market predominance, which isn't the case on our side.

"My comment was specifically related to why it has not grown on desktop, not what made it popular and successful elsewhere. Neither did I say the Linux community was ""a"" problem.

Yes, decentralization, freedom, ease of sharing, ease of modification/forking have enormous benefits.

However these values can also hold it back when it comes to **mainstream desktop** adoption. The only distro that managed to break into mainstream on an end-user device (besides routers and appliances) was Android/Linux and there's a reason for that -- its much easier for vendors and developers to support it, yet it achieves this by lessening or prohibiting the values both of us have mentioned.

The problem I was noting was the community itself has extensive elitist and toxic traits that can both hinder collaboration after internal disagreements and work against new users, and that partially explains why new users are like a revolving door, most of which return to Windows, as the stats typically indicate.

With Linux the community support is often more important than with other OSes, end-users must deal with it -- yet it is by far the most toxic and elitist. That is a huge problem.

That's not an easy problem to solve. Just look at how Linus talks to his own contributors, some of which have now ceased contributing after his attitude. This occurs throughout the entire community, often with both users and developers being treated like shit, and it cannot be fixed with a patch or fork.

-	Aorementioned CUDA performance.
-	Nvidia doesn’t allow gpu iommu passthrough of enthusiast models to a virtualized windows guest. Only quadro can do that. Nerfed at the driver level, I’d the driver detects it’s in a vm. There are workarounds, such as hiding that fact from windows, or patching the driver.

"I understand that part, consumers have to take out what the producers put in otherwise things get hot. 

I'm talking about something else, that there is an excess of energy being produced all over the world that has nowhere to go. Why is the excess there? You'd have to ask the local government. In China for example there is a lot of hydroelectric. If bitcoin didn't exist to consume that excess energy, would that excess energy not be produced? It still would.

When most people describe a doomsday scenario with bitcoin boiling the oceans because all the fossil fuels get burnt to produce electricity for mining, they happily discount that it's trivial for authorities to shut those things down. Ask illegal weed growers if they have a hard time hiding from the police, they totally do. A power company is like that but way hotter, it's impossible to hide it. So if it really ends up being a problem (I don't think it will) then local authorities will be able to act on it.

By the way if you want to make a fair comparison why don't you look at how much energy your dollars or euros consume? That includes the legacy servers, all of the government needed, the entire US military to protect it. 

Also its not like miners have unlimited money (governments do which is why they are so wasteful), so they have an incentive to find the cheapest source of energy and use as little of it as possible. What happens when solar becomes cheaper than gas?

And finally, all of our lives consume. If you don't want to consume then ceasing to exist is the only way to do that. Nobody gets to decide for someone else how much they are allowed to consume, it is up to each individual to decide that for themselves.

First we tried using PrivacyTools' instance but that thing crapped out and after half a week of it not working, I decided to set up a EMS-hosted server for us to use as 10$ didn't seem like an amount that I would miss, but that was a mess in the beginning and my friend had to fight his browser and phone to wrangle the key-sync and secure-chats to actually work. When the dust was settled for him, it was my turn to find out that Element's FDroid-version lacks functional notifications and as such for nearly half of January we had stunted conversations with super long breaks in-between because we aren't plastered to our phones' screens. I then tried Fluffychat, as I had tried it in the past and it said it supported MicroG for notifications, but that was a fucking lie. Next I tried Syphon, but that app is unfinished and unusable if you already have synced your keys on another client...

TLDW? What exactly is a stateless video decoder and how does it relate to the commonly known VAAPI?,0,0.11955402694454598
"Simplifying a bit, a compressed video stream is basically a continuous sequence of data (the compressed frame) and metadata (what parameters have been used to compress that frame). That sequence is called a bitstream. 

Now, any generally useful codec these days will use temporal compression, which means that in addition to the compression typically being used for an image compression algorithm, they will also be able to have compression between frames. For example, if the image was completely still, you'd just store the information that it's basically the previous frame. You will also have things like motion vectors, so let's say if you have a tracking shot from left to right (so with parts appearing on the right, and disappearing on the left), you would encode that the central part of the frame has moved left, and just add the new content on the right. 

This is all used to provide a compression as efficient as possible, but that means that you also have to have a list of the references images that have been used to compress the current image.  So you need to keep the former images (and parameters) over, and this is what the ""state"" is.

There's two main classes of hardware video decoders, the stateful and stateless decoders. The stateful decoders are able to process the entire bitstream themselves, so you pretty much only have to put the bitstream somewhere in memory, point the decoder to it, and it will start to output decoded frames. It will keep the state somewhere in the hardware and you won't have to worry about it, hence why it's stateful.

The stateless ones however need to be provided the data and metadata separately, since they aren't able to process the bitstream directly. In Linux, that means that the user-space needs to pre-process the bitstream, and then feed the data and metadata to the kernel. And the state has to be provided every time, hence why they are called stateless.

Stateful hardware codecs are mostly on the way out and are dropped in favor of stateless codecs since the stateless are so much simpler to design in hardware.

VA-API is a userspace API that abstracts away how a particular hardware codec needs to be programmed from its user (usually media players). In essence, it's similar to what OpenGL is for the 3D acceleration.",0,0.08754087818299491

2 years ago I decided to experiment with Linux and installed arch (probably because of memes and because I wanted to experiment and not actually use it). A few months later, I hardly ever booted into windows, so well yeah. I am happy with it.

Am I a better or more intelligent person because of this? definitely not. Most people that actually actually code a lot use other distros.

In my experience, the arch subreddit is pretty nice, people are giving long answers to ""dumb"" questions, explaining a little background and stuff like that. About the arch forums I honestly don't know but I've heard a lot of negative things about their ""kindness""(deleting everything stuff that had already been answered / is in the wiki), but on the other hand they feel pretty ""sorted"" when reading (I've only read threads I found by googling and not asked something myself)

Then there is the I use arch btw circlejerk. I don't know how many of those just use arch, feel actually superior because of it or just want to troll/live the meme etc etc. And I totally understand that it annoys people (including me) if this is spammed all the time.

What kind of triggers me, is that on the meme side of subreddits (linuxmemes), I see a lot more memes depicting arch users as people craving for saying ""I use arch btw"" than actual post saying this. This honestly makes me feel bad and a little angry...

But i also think that it can sometimes be frustrating trying to help people that just provide very vague answers (doesn't boot, don't have internet what now?) there's a million things that can be the reason and we can't help without a little more information, again that doesn't justify any toxicity but i can see how sometimes it can be tiring to help those new users.  

And it's not like the new users mean any wrong, they just aren't experienced enough to provide more info on what they are doing when following the wiki or when watching a youtube video(that is probably outdated and no longer works but that's for another day) which goes back to the original point , if someone is completly new to Linux why are they installing Arch in the first place?  

It's not that Arch is difficult but it requires a little bit of familiarity, i'm all for people doing whatever they want in Linux but i just think that starting with something like Arch doesn't make sense for me and it can be very frustrating trying to setup everything up when it's a whole new world that you are yet to discover, at the end of the day we want to install Linux to use our computers, we don't want to use our computers to install Arch.",1,0.7770190034570864

"I disagree with your premise.  I've posted some questions on the Arch forums.  I was told basically told to RTFM.  But the thing was that was accompanied by a link to the part of the wiki I needed, and it fixed my problems.

One in particular I remember about a problem with Steam and it involved a number of back-and-forths, and in the end I got it sorted.  You can see the post [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=251924).  As you can see if you read it, I did my best to provide as much information in my post as possible.  I did this by doing a simple search on the forum for people with trouble with Steam, and seeing what the responders asked for.  I then ran those commands and posted the output in my original post.  In the end, the solution was in a part of the wiki I should have already tried if I'm honest.

The person who solved my problem was patient and helpful.  I guess this is because my post wasn't '*Steam is crashing...help!*'.  I took a little initiative and did my best to not waste their time.  Contrast this with the endless, incessant amounts of people who post on this sub with 'I've installed Arch and it's stuck on Grub' or 'My Nvidia thing won't work, here's a screenshot, what do I do?'.  Maybe if they did a simple search they could check the plethora of people with the same issue and maybe sort it out themselves.

I don't deny there's some elitism in Arch.  But it's not a beginner disto and you're expected to put in some effort yourself.  If you want your hand held all the way, stick to Ubuntu.

Or I was able to find the solution of the problem with the help of the information mentioned in the post within a few seconds via Google. In such cases I assume that the person seeking help did not even try to solve the problem himself. 

In such cases I sometimes refer to [smart questions](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). But nowadays this is often considered by many as a personal attack. But from my point of view it is only a hint how to do it better in the future. 

Finally I would like to mention that many people offer help in their spare time and are not paid for it. And I just don't want to type an error message from a screenshot that was taken with a mobile phone camera in the worst case. It's also easier to copy the error message in Terminal Emulator and paste it into a post in Reddit, for example. In short, help us so we can help you.",0,0.22557944099595614

"Of course there are also people who help but behave badly. Smart questions"" also addresses this problem (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#idm667).

In my experience, such cases are much less likely (but not impossible since there are always idiots) if questions are asked as smart as possible.

But in certain cases I can understand the frustration of the people helping. For example when questions are not or only partially answered. Or when one really has to beg for every information. If you've been playing this game for years, you'll get tired of it. For my part, I prefer to leave the discussion completely in such cases rather than start personal attacks. But if everyone who wants to help does so, then at some point there will be nobody left who can help. 

Therefore, both bearings should move more towards each other. In my opinion, the camp of those seeking help should take a bigger step.

Nobody (at least not me) demands that the question has to be asked perfectly. But even a beginner should be able to provide the following information on his own:

- Distribution and package version used (If it plays a role also which hardware)
- Description of the problem (""does not work"" is not a description)
- Error message (if available) in text form (not as screenshot)
- What has already been tried to solve the problem?

These points alone would help a lot.

And yes, in my opinion that is something you can expect even from a beginner. For my part, I, for example, can drive a car, refill oil and water for the windscreen wiper. Not much more either. Nevertheless, I can explain any problems I may have as detailed as possible to the employee in a workshop.

So Facebook gets pissed that Perv is dancing through there system but decides not to simply ban all tor access since china and north korea like that feature.  So Zuck hires some evil genius to roll out a new facebook embedded video player globally with a known exploit tailored for the one job of getting the real IP of a tails user.  In order to trigger the exploit, they added some special data to the video stream.

In all seriousness, though, the open and extremely fragmented nature of Linux makes these kinds of exploits inevitable.

Someone who can find ways to financially profit from an exploit will be just as willing to inspect the code as someone doing it for public benefit (if not more) and would have more money to invest in helpful resources.

FBI obtained a warrant, so a judge approved it to happen. Facebook could have gone to court and tried to fight it but they probably would have lost (and the optics wouldn't be too good either.. ""Facebook protects Pedophile!"" would be the headlines everywhere).

If Facebook wasn't involved, then the victim still could have sent it without Facebook's knowledge or consent.

Classic engineering is more alike infrastructure development in the IT world than software development.

"I'd strongly agree with this.

Mathematicians, in my view, introduce some bad habits into programming, based on good intentions.

Namely, they tend to prioritise maximum compactness and concision over clarity and verbosity. The desire to reduce things to their absolutely most economical and minimal form of expression is a good motivation, and things that are small are elegant, but in programming it leads to unnecessary difficulty if the principal is extended to a fanatical degree.

Consider most examples you see of algorithms in many textbooks etc., in whatever code/pseudocode they like. Rather than use self-descriptive and helpful terms, instead all of the variables and iterators will end up being called i,j,k,p,q,r etc, making what they represent completely opaque.

Making code a little more verbose so that it is self-describing, making nomenclature and terminology a little more expanded than is absolutely necessary makes life a lot easier. And finally, on top of that, code should always be well commented. I think the assumption that whoever is reading it ""should just be able to figure it out"" is a really bad habit, IMO. Adding a descriptive line to your function or in critical/complex parts of code adds literally seconds (since 99% of your time is spent figuring stuff out/fixing the bugs) in the process, but could save another person (or yourself, if you haven't read your own code in months/years) countless hours.

Mathematics is beautiful but brutally, brutally  terse. Good code should be economical and elegant, but not to the point where it is opaque and impossibly complicated to untangle. This is where I think mathematics can go to far. Code should blend mathematical elegance with the poetry and communicative power of natural language.",1,0.6944352197132294

Not a lot of people have worked on through scan-build's report so there's a good chance you can find something here to make your first commit. If you do, there are lots of good tutorials on how to submit a patch. But first, [remember this advice:your fix should make the code cleaner not just make the warning go away](https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/27/131)

If you are successful, there are other tools such as coverity and Sparse. Over the years, I've seen many patches that address problems found by these tools.",0,0.12670868406205638
"Most people get into OSS (kernel or otherwise) by first ""scratching their own itch"". Typically this will be finding a bug or a missing feature (such as a non or poorly supported device).

It doesn't sound like this is your case.
Is there a particular reason you want to contribute to the kernel specifically?
There are lots of other OSS projects that are more in need of new developers than the kernel (which has several thousand developers working in it, mostly paid).

If you want to do it to be close to the hardware it may be worth looking at embedded stuff.

In my experience it's fairly easy to successfully contribute bug fixes and new drivers for an existing subsystem. It is much harder, unless you have a proven track record, to get significant changes to existing code accepted.

I would advise against doing trivial patches like white space cleanup.
One place you could look is drivers/staging which contains drivers judged not clean enough for the main kernel. Problem is that to work properly on a driver you really need to have the corresponding hardware otherwise you risk breaking things.",0,0.16113358518875276
"Most FOSS contribution is either individuals adding features they personally want, or businesses paying people to develop. I would not try to program specifically for the kernel unless you have a feature you want to develop that can ONLY be in the kernel. The two domains, kernel space and user space, are separated for a reason, and kernel space  has a lot less margin for error.",0,0.43706439433101957
"You can always help upstream / write drivers for ARM dev boards.
Also OpenWRT can need some help with porting to new routers (often creating a device tree config is enough) - check out [the forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/c/devel).
Getting some unsupported USB device to work is also a good challenge.

There are some [very cheap](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-FL2000.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.1fc44f5dwkQto8&CatId=7) USB-VGA/HDMI dongles for which the vendor provided [some example code](https://github.com/FrescoLogic/FL2000) - it just displays some user supplied images. Now the challenge is to write a proper DRM driver. [`udl`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/udl) and [`tinydrm`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/tiny) (especially the [`gm12u320`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/gm12u320.c) driver) is probably a good starting point.

If you are just getting into kernel programming, Microcontroller Operating Systems like [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/) and [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) are an easy way in.
They are less complex than Linux, have many open TODOs that are made easy by Microcontroller Documentation usually being readily available - and the hardware is pretty cheap too.",0,0.1837504334719214

This is uncertain as far as my knowledge goes, but maybe, just maybe, the SSD firmware would not write all those transactions as fast as they occurred. Instead they could've been written in bulk or allow the LVM caching to write them directly to the HDD.  
To my defense it was hard to find a definitive answer if a not-top-tier disk has DRAM or not (unless it's hidden under the term ""cache"").

Just a bit info on DRAM-less SSD:

DRAM on SSD is mainly used to store the table that translates the LBA (addressing used by your host PC) and the NAND physical address during run-time. The ratio between the table and capacity is about 1:1000. This means 1TB drive requires about 1GB DRAM. 

A lot of SSD and SSD controller companies came up with some techniques to avoid using DRAM, but instead just store the translation table in the memory internal to the controller. This done mainly due to cost but also sometimes due to the PCB real estate. So based on those two factors if the SSD is pretty cheap and/or it is a small form factor (gum stick), very likely it does not use DRAM.

While DRAM-less SSDs usually have lower performance, they are not necessarily more prone to data integrity issue. While storing the translation table in the internal memory gives the controller faster access, this internal memory is very small compared to DRAM, this means  more swapping between the NAND and internal RAM that cause more writes to the NAND.",0,0.21228652890137492

Some effort needs to be done to get smdev/nldev/nlmon/nltrigger working (their s6-rc service files are present, but they're the first thing I'll be working on once I get a working graphics stack which would take some time).

Regarding firmwares, well since this is a musl based distribution, you can't expect it to have the proprietary NVIDIA drivers for example, but since it's extremely lightweight and highly optimized, you may notice a decent increase in the performance of the open-source NVIDIA driver nouveau (I understand this may not be needed, but still better than nothing).

After a few weeks with Windows, I really regretted the switch. I've been running Debian on my servers for more than 2 decades.

On the flip-side, having used Arch for a while now, even if I don't agree, I *understand* where the attitude comes from. The ""Newbie Corner"" is for *Arch* newcomers*,* not *Linux* newcomers. Arch was not designed for Linux newcomers in mind, and being able to follow a step-by-step guide to get it installed does not mean that the ""how do I delete a file?"" is an acceptable question for the Arch Newbie Corner.

A question regarding using PKGBUILD,  pacman, or something more Arch-specific, etc  is more  the intention of the Newbie Corner.

All that said, I do agree that there is no reason to be a dick, or be rude to strangers. There are indeed real people on the receiving end of rude posts.

I even had one fellow tell me that newbies ""hadn't earned the right to be respected"", like tenured users had, or something equally toxic. It's just a sad mindset. The distro isn't even *that* hard to install or use...but a certain minority of users seem to consider themselves the elite of the elite because they can do basic UNIX admin (configuring CUPS, etc).

It's more of an Arch problem than a Linux problem, in my experience. Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, etc are pretty welcoming. It's a shame, because Arch is actually my favorite distro. It just happens to be a lightning rod for a certain type of self-important misanthrope.

EDIT: For context, I had been using Linux for years before I switched to Arch. It was not difficult, and I don't think I've ever been ""the noob"" when dealing with Arch.

"So much shitty arrogance in IT/Development/Systems/DevOps/WhateverOps , it's can really get to you and I can understand why so many really good people leave the industry all together or just become monsters themselves :-/


I'm going to throw a theory out there as to why this might be, _testosterone_ :P, I think that could be 90% of the issue. Another theory relates to the type of work we are doing, knowledge work which has many levels of abstraction and takes many skill sets to be _capable_ in. You learn different things and have different perspectives at different levels of experience and understanding, this will be constantly changing and often along the way you will feel you are in a current state of ""being right"". Everyone wants and has so much pressure to be right a lot of the time. Deadlines are so tight, the cost of errors still so high that it's often your personal crusade to be right. Good organisations are able to understand that what you implement and get working will always be wrong and iterating over time. When you learn something it involved bring many _chunks_ of knowledge into a new stream of thought for a new _chunk_. We've all been doing for how ever many years or months and lose knowledge of that learning experience, which results in a lack of empathy for our fellow workers/learners. This can create a lot of tension and causes a lot of people lash out at new people. Everyone's learning path is different, not everyone will know the exact same thing. This is not a downfall of your team/group/organisation/tribe, this should be a recognised as a positive. Diversification and different learning experiences and pathways can add a lot to your team, best(worst) of all you might find knowledge caps in your own learning, this can again upset people because they feel, as the _Senior_ blah-da-blah role that they should know the most and direct on decisions.


What makes this even worse is how _Heroes_ are rewarded and held in such high regards in a lot of organisations.. This is the worst aspect of work for me, working 60-80 hours a week,, no family or fewer family/life commitments, being the best at solving things as an individual and having to always be right... it's exhausting for everyone else, managers, they aren't that great. They are great for managed/professional service companies because projects don't have longevity and being able to produce short term results is so important but for the rest of us it sucks.


I'm with you, don't be a dick, if someone doesn't know something or has a different approach see this as an opportunity and put forth empathy as your first reaction. Show them an alternative option, your perspective. More often then not I've seen peoples arrogance(fear)  cause them to dig into only supporting their own solution but keep working with them, the team, see what you can get out of the experience and if need be, move on.

"There really is a very toxic minority in the GNU/Linux community, but in this comment, I would like to focus on something very positive that I have recently experienced, instead:

I've recently been dabbling with Gentoo and trying to get it run, and I must say; the Gentoo community is really awesome!

I read the handbook, but I still got a few problems while installing and the people on IRC were just wonderful; there was a person who spent 20 minutes of their time trying to help me. They also went the extra mile and gave me a few tips on things to do after I actually install and configure the system! <3

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for a lot of the experiences I have had in other GNU/Linux communities; we have a very toxic minority in our community that is very elitist and enjoys bringing down newbies.

Because of the experiences I had with other GNU/Linux communities, I was initially very hesitant to join the gentoo channel on freenode and ask my questions, but I was so pleasantly surprised.

I encountered other problems while installing that I was able to solve by googling and finding forum posts by other beginners who encountered similar problems. The feeling I got by reading the forum posts is that the Gentoo community is extremely friendly and welcoming to beginners.

I might be wrong, since I am new to Gentoo; maybe Gentoo also has an elitist and toxic minority, but the friendliness I experienced in the Gentoo community really left a wonderful taste in my mouth.

So, I guess the behavior OP is describing really depends on what community you are in and the kind of behavior the community encourages.

Unfortunately, the toxic and elitist behavior that a minority of the GNU/Linux community is plagued with is not limited to GNU/Linux; I've experienced similar things while studying computer-science. There are a lot of elitists and dicks in computer-science, as well. But one thing I realized is that truly knowledgeable people are usually very humble and friendly, because what I have realized is that the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. The elitist dicks are usually the ones who don't know as much as they want you to think, but they are insecure about their lack of knowledge and cover it up by pretending that newbies are beneath them.",0,0.15394149360071174

to be clear, that's not to excuse or comment on the community in any way (honestly i don't check the forums so i'm not completely sure what's going on there). it's really unfortunate that there is such an elitist attitude, and it would really hinder new users from using it. although i haven't seen it much from the arch forums (again, because i don't really check them), i've seen it in other areas in computing (stackoverflow comes to mind), and as a newbie in so many fields, it's seriously frustrating. but i don't think you should not use a tool just because there's a negative reputation for people using that tool.

to clarify again though, if your issue is that the community isn't helping you, making it hard to use the distro, that's a different issue, and fair enough for leaving because of that, because that actually prevents you for using it well. but i personally think this culture of not using a tool for the sole reason that you don't want to be associated with xyz people is honestly not a very good reason to stop using it.",0,0.21437980819682423

"I honestly think this is a user-generational thing.

Up until ~2003-2005, most linux users *were* highly technical CS or engineering people. It was a small, somewhat tight knit group of users who had the capability of solving problems themselves (for various reasons; system complexity was lower, average user skill was higher, many users coming from other unix-like systems). Usually you knew somebody personally, through your LUG or a colleague etc, who could help you w/ most issues.

In that gap until circa 2012, gnu/linux has grown up significantly and the huge swing toward web applications has made it dramatically more accessible to less technical users. Developers start getting a lot of the same basic questions, problem report quality drops, and we don't yet have good ecosystem tools to manage support for the much larger user-to-developer ratio. Developer-user interaction became a lot less personal because unless the user contributes, they don't stand out from the noise; social apathy/exhaustion sets in. New users try linux, can't get help, realize its not ready for them, and go back to what they were using before. For many, it only takes one bad interaction or one significant blocker to leave a bad taste, and it's happening far too often.

Post-2008 until now we get the stack overflow, askubuntu, archwiki generation. We started building much more readily searchable repositories for common user questions--user cookbook solutions instead of scanning mailing lists to figure out which combination finally resolved something. We have a lot higher awareness of keyword and link referral SEO, as well as user search bubbles. It has become acceptable--recommended even--to answer your own question with a solution. Users vastly outnumber developers now; telling users to ""read the source"" is fully nonsensical. A significant number of the long term users started in or suffered through the ""Can't get help"" period and identify/empathize more with other new users having problems than they do with developers. That empathy comes across in user-to-user interaction.

Arch is actually an interesting community because of what it is: the bleeding edge developer and early adopter users subgroup. It has the qualities from all three of my time periods because the users are a significant percentage developers, being bleeding edge means feature documentation is low and at the same time, the bug resolution rate is high and it generates FAQ documentation prodigiously.

"One way to think about niche pulseaudio fills is that it's a windowing system (aka compositor) for audio. Just like a windowing system allows several graphic buffers to be seen on a single video output at once, a sound compositor allows several sound sources to be heard on a single output.  It's not a multiplexer however, in the sense most people understand multiplexing.

The idea of a sound compositor itself is perfectly fine, pretty much has to be done to allow multiple apps to produce sound at the same time. It's the implementation details in pulseaudio that draw most of the criticism.

ALSA means two mostly unrelated things, causing a lot of confusion. There's a kernel interface (a bunch of ioctl that work on devices in /dev/snd) which is called ALSA, and then there's a very extensive userspace library also called ALSA or sometimes alsalib. The kernel interface is fine. The library is not. It's not just a bunch of wrappers for the kernel interface, it does a lot of stuff including limited multiplexing and mixing which really, really shouldn't be done in a library. To make matters worse, it happens to be the default way to get the ioctl wrappers, so people who'd be rather talking to the kernel interfaces directly end up linking and depending on all that userspace stuff as well.

One question that I never managed to find a good answer to wrt audio in Linux, is what about hardware-assisted mixing? Pulseaudio to my best knowledge does it all on the CPU, that's the audio equivalent of software rendering. Just like with window compositing, audio mixing should benefit a lot from being offloaded to a dedicated DSP, and I'm pretty sure there were cards capable of doing that at least 20 years ago. The whole Windows/Linux argument becomes much less clear if say Window is capable of HW offloading on cards that support it while Linux doesn't do that.

Alsa no longer needs pulse audio, it can now ""multiplex"" or mix as you say, the many audio sources, but in reality nobody seems interested to properly implemented that down deep in ALSA.....

"> Buy a good external DAC, turning a digital signal into analog inside of a PC case is a bad idea due to electromagnetic interference.

Depends on the hardware. Laptops tend to have worse sound quality than desktops. Desktops and workstations are variable, which indeed has a lot to do with EMI inside the case. But plenty of workstations and desktop products fabulous sound quality. Users won't necessarily see any improvements by buying an external DAC, especially if they're not using a laptop.

">MYTH: Lossless sounds better than lossy. This is blatantly untrue, lossless audio formats were created for perservation and archival reasons. When you encode a lossy file from a lossless source, and you make sure that it's a 48kHz, 16-bit PCM encoding, you will not lose any important information. What is enough depends on the quality of the encoder. For OggVorbis, 192kbps is sufficient, for MP3, 256kbps should be preferred. 320kbps is excessive and the highest quality supported by MP3. In general, 256kbps does the trick, but with storage being abundant these days, you can play it safe and use 320kbps if it makes you feel better.

I can blindly tell the difference between FLAC and properly encoded Opus (Vastly superior to MP3 and noticeably better than Vorbis) on my setup. What you write is true for most speakers and most sound chips, but the further down the rabbit hole you go, it becomes clear that some of that ""unimportant information"" still makes a huge difference to the overall sound of the track.

The latency in Pulse mostly comes from how well its settings match the native PCM format of your DAC/sound card. If Pulse is configured to match your DAC, the latency should be pretty indiscernible. Another setting that'll matter is the resampling method, some are more expensive than others, and this can add latency.

It assumes that it won't have to do that again, so it gets rid of it after that.

That's a strong assertion.  In my experience that's not the case since it happens on a variety of hardware (3 different setups) and a variety of configurations (literally 1000's).  IMO, it is often a problem caused due to latency induced from multiplexing.  The skips/stutters that I'm talking about are the inverse of latency (the skips occur because one hits the max latency boundary).  Even with a ""max latency"" of 200ms, I get skips/stutters with PA on certain sources (direct from CD source, bluetooth A2DP, ...).   You can see the effect of this, by doing a parec and noting 20ms-40ms of flat-0 wav output (probably a dozen per hour and definitely noticeable).

Back when I was playing around with JACK, I tried the solution you mentioned, but sadly, it didn't work out as I expected.

While yes, I could reroute **JACK** audio sources, anything generated by Pulseaudio itself came out of 1 source in JACK, so for my purposes (e.g. send audio from VoIP call to headphones only, send audio from game to both headphones and OBS) it didn't work, as to JACK it was all one _thing_ that couldn't be divvied up.

Just right now, I'm trying out JACK (again) but without PA redirection, to see what kind of compatibility I can expect from the programs I use regularly.

Out of the box, neither FF nor Chromium work (even though I had read that FF had JACK support, maybe I misread it, maybe the Arch package doesn't have that compiled in), OBS Studio (another one I thought had JACK support but seemingly the Arch package doesn't have it compiled in) also doesn't work, Overwatch and Undertale have no sound and Discord doesn't work either.

Even though I can get software that requires PA to work with JACK, I seemingly still need to manually fiddle around with the PA sinks (i.e. create a JACK sink per program so that I can route each program individually in QJackCTL) to get what I want. At that point I'm just doing [this](https://endless.ersoft.org/pulseaudio-loopback/) but with jack-sinks as opposed to null-sinks.

PulseAudio was trying to solve mixing, but at the time other mixing solutions existed and ALSA could also do it. That's probably not relevant to a factual post, but it is relevant to why PulseAudio wasn't instantly accepted by the user base.

PulseAudio is still in development and does still push broken releases. A recent release on Gentoo needed it's default compile flags changed so it didn't grab GB's of memory to itself. I've not heard of that kind of problem with ALSA for a long long time.

The Linux audio drivers have generally excellent support and are well written, it's usually the soundcard / chip combo producers that cause the problems with 38 slightly different versions of the same chip, all of which require careful tweaks. 99% of the time those tweaks now work out of the box, in very rare circumstances you may need to add kernel boot or module load options to correctly configure the driver. That's not ALSA's fault. That's the kernel drivers.

If you go looking somewhere like the Steam forums you will see many current issues getting games working well with PulseAudio, and virtually none of those problems will be traced back to ALSA being the problem.

Pulse does do a lot more than it needs to, and a lot more than your list. It tries to define default sinks, adjusts your available hardware input / output options depending on if you dare to plug an audio jack in, attempts to ""cork"" streams when it thinks it needs to (and it isn't always right about it), and generally reduces the capability of most soundcards that ALSA exposes.

ALSA never failed me, the worst I experienced was some odd issues with a handful of steam games that came down to said complex asound.conf rather than ALSA itself.

Either way, for archival purposes I'd recommend a lossless format, like FLAC. That way you can transcode them to whatever lossy format you find most convenient in the future.

Originally you argue that ALSA shouldn't allow mixing to be avoided. Now you argue that it's fine that PulseAudio can avoid it. It's important because if you force PulseAudio to use ALSA's mixing you get added latency and another mixing buffer that you don't need. It's not a no-op. Again you don't seem to understand what you're arguing about.

"Now you are just being obtuse. The fact is, humans can feel Infra/ultra sound, and modern audio components are capable of producing those ranges. Why would a company spend the money to produce tweeters that can produce 28khz, or subs that output below 20hz if it doesn't make a difference?  

If you stand next to someone firing a shotgun, you feel the shot go off. If you use ear protection you don't have a ringing in your ears, but you still feel the thump in your chest. There is also a range of weapons created to use infrasound, lookup LRAD, they were designed for crowd control. 

You might consider this this my subjective experience, but the facts are out there that prove that infra/ultra sound can affect the human body, and IMO it does affect the listener when hearing music.

Many were interesting or very good in particular ways. Such as herbstluftwm's being nothing but a bash script, which is certainly simple and easy to work with. But, they usually end up wanting something key or making some simple daily task harder to do and so don't last for me. I did very much like i3-gaps and polybar and used it for quite a long time. It is very configurable and relatively easy to work with, all things considered, but still gives a modern slick looking desktop. Most tiling WMs look ugly, but i3 and polybar actually look good which is nice.

But, without fail, I always come back to Openbox and tint2. It is easily the best combination of lean and full featured I have ever used. I have yet to find myself disappointed that something necessary was missing. The configurations, as mentioned above, are a little less elegant being xml, but they are definitely simple and direct. And the theming is just beyond any other WM for customizing. Creating an entirely new custom theme is simply stupidly easy with just a single text rc file and some xpm images for buttons. And tint2 is very similar, with just crazy levels of customization available and the ability to add various buttons. Together these two tools are simply so configurable and powerful that I can actually make different setups feel like entirely different window managers which sort of reduces any desire to hop to others. Instead I just hop within Openbox by creating new themes, layouts and looks giving me something entirely new while still being just as solid under the hood. And that is to ignore the amazing tools you can use to make things even easier, such as obconf and obmenu-generator.

After the usual Gnome / KDE environments, I started exploring WMs with E16, which was probably the most beautiful desktop experience I had.

Back then, on a pentium-II, seeing the kind of animations that e17 had was magic. Aesthetically though, I think I still preferred E16.

I think I moved to Fluxbox w/ Tint next... and then chanced upon dwm maybe 6-7 years ago I think. At that point of time, I was using a Eee PC and was actively trying to avoid using a mouse.

"Tiling, IMHO, never turns out as useful as it sounds. For more than 90% of the time I run no more than two windows (it's probably more like 98%). Starting with the third window almost all splitting algorithms result in such tiny frames that they become virtually if not entirely unusable. If you do use more than two windows you usually have to manually resize windows to get things to be workable, and this adds steps that take away from the supposed time-saving factor. Or, as I do more often, I use another workspace and move back and forth as needed between them. And this is, honestly, something done more easily, flexibly and powerfully on a traditional floating WM.

So, in practice, I find most of my needs can be solved by just maximizing a window, which is to recreate the most common tiling situation. Then, when using two I can snap them, using a key binding for the job, to the left and right half of the screen. This means that for 90+ percent of my reasons for ever wanting a tiling WM are covered by no more than a couple of keyboard presses on a floating one. And though I may have to do more work when using three or more windows that is a very rare event and doesn't work effectively in tiling in the first place. Actually, it is much more common for me to need to do something requiring floating on a tiling WM than the reverse, and that is usually much more complicated and awkward than doing some limited tiling on Openbox. And because of the keyboard quirks of tiling I can do it in Openbox with more intuitive keybindings that are less ergonomically challenging.

It just doesn't result in enough benefits for me to be worth that work, and during that process it is more clumsy. I see it kind of like people who learn Dvorak keyboards.

"Same here in Brazil. The organization where I work doesn’t support Linux. It means I can’t access internal network, file server and stuff. After several, many many, conversations with IT team, they agreed to provide a VPN service to provide “alternative OS” users with organization’s IT services. 

Another case is the Brazilian parliament, which has a system where people can “upvote or downvote” newly proposed acts, laws and regulations. There you have to input ID numbers and an email account. The thing is they only accept big companies domains (gmail, yahoo, etc; I have protonmail.). And this is non-sense. I had to submit a formal complain and they answer me positively saying the case is being analyzed. 

To sum up, most people don’t have the habit of propose something different, so governments and organizations end up doesn’t knowing your real needs.

"If you're talking about playback, then, no. The problem they are talking about is with capture, that is, sound from the microphone or a line-in source. A problem with playback is more likely to be a problem with speech-dispatcher if it happens while you have Firefox open. You can check it out by quitting Firefox when it happens. If the problem goes away, then it is almost certainly the speech dispatcher issue.

If it is the speech dispatcher issue, then you can also fix it temporarily by finding and killing the speech dispatcher process, but to fix it permanently go into about:config in Firefox and make the following change:

media.webspeech.synth.enabled false

That should stop speech dispatcher from starting. You most likely won't miss it. I think it's used to have Firefox read text from Web pages to you. Most people don't need that (though there are those that do, so it would be nice if the bug were fixed).",0,0.4287011582914296

"Hello there. I've recently dipped my toes in the water by installing Pop!OS on an older machine of mine (i5-6500, Gigabyte Z170-HD3P, Sapphire RX580, 8GB DDR4-2800, SATA SSD) and it works fine OOTB.

&#x200B;

Now since i have a z-chipset motherboard, it's possible for me to raise the Baseclock by raising the BCLK-value. This works really well when booting to Legacy or UEFI installations of Windows 10. The +25% i put in (3.2GHz -> 4.0GHz) uplift is rather conservative, since the chip handles like a champ without taking extra voltage or anything. I know it's stable, i stresstested it extensively (not just power on, hwmonitor, some youtube and power off again). In Windows.

&#x200B;

When i try to boot to Pop!OS, i always end up in the GRUB menu and after selecting a boot option i get an empty screen save for one underscore character in the top left. All system fans go to 100%.

&#x200B;

I realize this is a rather niche usecase (OCing a normally un-OCable cpu), but maybe by chance someone can point me in the right direction.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

system boots to windows 10 no problem on stock settings

system boots to Pop!OS no problem on stock settings

system boots to windows 10 no problem on overclock settings

LLVM major releases are rare and so are patch releases. Plus, it's an important system component, at least on Linux systems. So distribution updates are handled conservatively.

So if you find a problem in the latest LLVM release that leads to bad shader compiles with Mesa, or even crashes, you might have to wait for over *half a year* to get a fix shipped to end users. Sometimes you can workaround in Mesa, but not always.

It's the same for new hardware support. It can take many months to get it from LLVM master into end user's hands.

But here the part where the argument for ""LLVM just doesn't optimize for speed"" get iffy, it's true that in a larger set of code, LLVM can get slow on compilation, but in GPU-based code, those tend to be rather small from what I observed when compared to projects like Gnome, Gimp, and so forth. In JIT, you aren't re-compiling the same code every time you want to run that code, you only compile it once and then re-use the same code over and over as many times as you want and you can even save that compiled code to hard drive and re-use it later. There are a lot of different paradigms that can be tried to avoid recompilation and handle a wider scope of problems with the same code.

">The only reason people think LLVM is some great thing is because it has  Apple/Google marketing behind it, and the reason corporations like it is  because it allows proprietary code.

I don't know too much about GCC, but I would say LLVM/clang has a couple of things going for it that can't just be from ""marketing"":

1. It's trivial for beginners to get involved making significant changes to the compiler. [Writing a pass is extremely easy](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html) and the code is well-documented and organized. It's written in C++ which, for a compiler, makes the code much more readable and easily extended. Recently GCC has moved to C++.
2. One of the best selling points of LLVM/clang is that you can have the compiler emit a human-readable IR (or it compiled in bitcode form) which can be reused for any purpose by external tools supporting LLVM IR or even different compilers or different versions of LLVM/clang. In my work it's very helpful to see how a change I made to the compiler affects  intermediate code generation. GCC, to my knowledge, has made it difficult to get this info for purposes of avoiding the creation of non-GPL external tools.

I do wish LLVM/clang was under a GPL license, though. I disagree with their argument that people will eventually give back because it's difficult to maintain a fork. I work at a company large enough to maintain a fork for years and unfortunately they have almost no incentive to push their changes to upstream, which they would if LLVM/clang was GPL-licensed.",1,0.678238316079147

I'm vaguely aware of those, but I don't think they compare to LLVM/clang's workflow, where I can just run `clang -c <file> -Xclang -emit-llvm` and get a single file that's the IR of the module after all high-level passes have been applied.

"> Do someone know if one can achieve this on a Raspberry Pi?

I can think of several methods ...

The simplest is probably the use of an extension which redirects matching web requests to an url in your local network. This uses part of the [webRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeRequest) that will be disabled in Chrome with the removal of Manifest v2 compatibility, but it will continue to work in Firefox and possibly other Blink forks that keep to the old feature set. It's the very method Decentraleyes uses, the only difference is that the extension doesn't redirect to moz-extension:// but to some device in your local network, so you could take a look at that code and use most of it.

You can also use the Pi as a web proxy and use custom cache durations for certain matches. Take squid proxy for example, with the [refresh_pattern](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/refresh_pattern/) directive you can determine that a matching request should *always* be filled from the local cache and never be updated from the original source, even if that was explicitly requested.

Another potential idea would be to modify the name resolution of the most common CDN (sub) domains with the help of PiHole, changing the target to somewhere in your local network. A custom scripting solution on the target server could then do any number of things. For example, first check if the requested url path is cached locally, if yes then simply output that file. If not, then fetch the file from the real CDN server on the internet, optionally store it locally and then forward it to the browser that requested it.

Either method could run along with PiHole on the same device, but the PiHole's dashboard/web interface would need to be moved first if you want to work on a custom solution that doesn't require the proxy configuration on target devices.

Another problem with the MITM method is that you'd basically be assuming the identity of a remote server and since the majority of web requests nowadays are over HTTPS, you'd need to create certificates for those domain names. This isn't a topic I'm very experienced in, but you'd need to add a trusted root certificate to each device this method is intended to work on, or they won't trust your self-signed certificates.",1,0.5842866843709418

"WebkitGTK is one of the few HTML libraries that is actually maintained competently.. or at least competently compared to other things.  It's actually best of breed when it comes to open source application libraries for html content as far as I can tell.

When Google created Webkit by forking it from KHMTL (From KDE's Konqueror) it became insanely popular to do webkit-this and webkit-that.  You had a rapid development of all sorts of html libraries for almost every variety or languages and toolkits under the sun. QT versions, Java versions, Python versions, etc.

Well most of them went to shit and were not maintained very well. After a few years they became riddled with bugs and security issues.  WebkitGTK wasn't perfect, but it was better then the rest.  There was quite a lot of drama over this a few years ago as the Linux desktop landscape was full of exploitable bugs in virtually every email client or rss reader or anything else that needed to render modern html well.

&#x200B;

The problem with WebkitGTK, generally speaking, isn't with the library... per say.  The problem is that distribution maintainers do a bad job keeping up to date on things or make changes to it to make it fit distribution licensing policies (and other political stuff) that end up breaking things for other people.

WWW tech is rapidly changing and insanely complex.  The whole system built around javascript and various web standards is mind-boggling in it's complexity.  So bugs and fixes and security issues and changes in standards come in at a constant clip.  IT's extremely difficult to keep up.

&#x200B;

Trying to shoehorn something like web technology libraries into a six month release cycle or 'Long Term Support' model is a recipe for disaster.    Just trying to put a some library related to that into a some repo and have it sit there for 4 years without touching it as much as possible isn't going to work.  The technology isn't going to sit still long enough to make that work.  Lots of software technology works very well with LTS or annual release models, but HTML rendering libraries are not one of them.

For example Debian backports have gotten much easier to use so that people are not stuck with broken, outdated, and insecure software for years and years.

"bzip2 is a core library. Which means an incredible number of people put trust in it. Do we want to jeopardize this really?

The problem with Rust is the safeguards require a quite bit of code generation and several steps of optimization. Language still lacks a compiler with stable ABI. Which means that when the compiler of a system is upgraded we need to recompile all Rust programs that interact with Rust libraries and the all of the libraries from scratch.

They will very likely use C ABI for seamless integration and binary compatibility. So for other languages there should be no difference in calling convention and binary compatibility. So at some point it needs to deal with insecure data structures like raw pointers anyway. Whether there will an optimized Rust binary interface for programs or not is a question. Whether a Rust compiler update requires a full rebuild of the system libraries is also is a very important question.

No nice and ionice only affect the CPU scheduling algorithms. I don't have swap and I don't care about it.

"The compositor owns the idea of window focus, so it'd be the right place to renice processes in theory, if most GUI applications played nicely to being reniced.

It's not exactly rocket surgery to implement either, but it's certain to uncover a lot of bugs in applications that expect certain scheduler behavior and choke in strange ways when they're not seeing it. The more benign/simple applications would probably not notice anything happened at all though. It's also going to lead to problems with distributed applications/things with GUI front-ends to daemon processes and other oddballs like desktop virtualization applications and video games.

If you wanted to get really deep into it, you could start putting desktop processes into their own cgroups and have a sort of 'userspace hierarchical scheduler' ala kubelet that dynamically changed the I/O priorities and memory reservations and such based on focus/application request.

"I have an experimental setup wherein I trapped each individual Postgres session process in its own control group in order to limit per-session memory as there is no such setting (work_mem is per query plan node, not global).


Memory limits in cgroups can be enforced in two ways:

- traditional OOM, which works fast since it is an arbitrated action and the kernel is not already scraping the bottom the barrel, however SIGKILL to a backend is a no-go as Postgres defensively resets the whole instance to prevent loose ends in the shared buffers.


- cause every process in the cgroup to receive no scheduling time until memory is freed. This is what I ended up using, but it's not straightforward as signal handlers for a clean termination are not scheduled either. I had to add a small ""balloon"" process to each group. What I do when saturation is reached is  SIGINT the Postgres child and then kill the balloon process to create some headroom & resume operations. Signals are asynchronous, so the handler is not 100% guaranteed to be the first thing to run once scheduling is resumed, but so far it never failed.


Beware that mmaped files don't count towards process resident set size, so it won't work for all applications, but Postgres uses none in the backend unless you deliberately tell it to.

"> yeah it's cool gaming is better, yeah a lot of desktops and software for linux has improved a ton, but general usability compared to windows/mac is such a pain point that it alone will hold people off linux

It's honestly come a long way. I admit a bias on my part as I've gotten far more competent and comfortable with linux as time goes on, but it is improving. There has been a recent push on the (g)UI/(g)UX side of things that's slowly paying dividends as well. Problem is those efforts are split on the various forks and flavors and implementations and thus a lot of time is spent reinventing - or at least reimplementing - the wheel for all the different Distros, DE's, WM's, DSP's, etc etc. As such, there is no central design/UX authority for linux as a whole. I don't really think there should be, and more importantly, don't see how there could be while still being linux as we know it. This is kind of a classic case of ""we have 14 different standards, we need to unify them all ... next thing we know we have 15 competing standards"" [insert relevant xkcd here].

For the longest time though, the GUI based environment in linux was frequently shunned, and those that did invest in it weren't doing so under a unified effort to deliver a singular UI/UX, to say nothing of their individual ability (or available time) to produce a high quality product. Those working on and in that space were more focused on adding new features here, and shiny new graphics there, and not on developing a clear, consistent style guide and implenting across the entire stack (DM, DE, WM, etc) to deliver not only on that visual aesthetic and style, but on a consistent and clear user *experience* as well. That has improved significantly recently, but the efforts are still fractured across this distro or that, or this DE or that. Again, consolidating all of that into one singular effort is never going to happen. The nature - and some would argue, the hole point - of linux and (F)OSS is to customize and experiment and innovate and make it your own, so even if someone were to lead such a charge, there would still be the other 9001 and different versions as well. 

So is it a messaging problem? Perhaps all these different distro's and their various flavors shouldn't be all marketed as a singular ""Linux OS experience."" Those of us in the linux community realize this internally, and yet there's still that ever repeated mantra of ""Year of the Linux Desktop."" Sure, those of us already drinking the koolaid recognize that means you can have all kinds of flavors and concoctions of said koolaid, but to everyone not already in the cool kids club, they read and perceive ""the linux desktop"" as a singular OS/experience. And it most certainly is not. And again, we don't see that as a problem, and yet, it's a significant hurdle/point of confusion for those outside the bubble. 


TL;DR: Variety is the spice of life, but if you haven't developed a taste and tolerance for that spice, it can burn you. The flavors have been getting better and better though as time goes on.",0,0.3108746259348673

"FWIW I run Fedora Workstation on my laptop and so do a few others for the same reasons as OP.

The main problem is central management and security, I bet.  

While I need to support the OS myself, I am compliant in the sense that:  
* my drive is encrypted  
* I run our corporate AV client with central management (BitDefender)  
* I run our corporate local IDS/firewall which is centtrally managed (CrowdStrike Falcon)  
* my screen auto-locks after x time

So it depends what tools you use within the company, but central management is usually the problem.

As others mentioned, you could use RH Sattelite (or the free upstream Foreman) to manage all the clients, and even have security compliance reports come in using OpenSCAP.  


You could also set it up in a way that you can auto-remediate using Ansible playbooks.  
This last thing requires proper access to the machine, though. So you would probably need to create an image or even betrer a centrally managed PXE environment with kickstart templates (very easy to do with Foreman).  

You can of course join these machines to the AD domain and have the benefits of being a Kerberos client. Although I would recommend setting up a FreeIPA environment for these clients (and your servers) these days.",0,0.30820877814063896

"Some thoughts:

- For security: any Linux computer can be controlled the same way as a server. So to check the security you can add the laptops to config management (ansible, puppet,...) This also makes it easy to install new software on machines. With apt-mirror you can host your own repository for software compatibility. (There's probably a yum equivalent for this.)

- I think the biggest issue is software compatibility. You have to make clear to users that choosing Linux won't allow them to have Microsoft office, Adobe,...

- the Linux desktop has really matured. You don't have to know command line anymore to use a system.

- the Ubuntu forums never failed to give an answer, often with pictures and howtos. Teach your users to use these wiki's.

- in my experience, Linux is a lot more stable if you pick LTS versions and software from the apt repos. This should lower helpdesk calls. For example: My parents, grandparents were all on Ubuntu 14.04. I never heard them and a couple months ago I upgraded them to 18.04. never heard of them in between... However they just use a browser, some documents and thunderbird.

- people often complain about their laptop becoming slower. Without serious cleanups on a Windows laptop every year, it really slows down a lot. On Linux/mac this problem never occured (in my experience).

- when there are serious issues, you can easily reinstall the OS if you keep a separate home partition. Also the reinstallation process of Linux is a lot faster than windows and Mac.

- you don't have to pay for overpriced Apple computers.

- a lot of applications are web based nowadays. So people often have many browser tabs open. Linux is conservative on killing browser tabs so people with low ram often experience lag. Make sure there is enough swap space. 
On 4GB ram laptops, I put a swap file of 10GB. People now open 50 tabs without issues. Standard Ubuntu install creates a swap file of 2GB which is way too small IMO.",0,0.1280953360742553

Team viewer or similar remote desktop apps work great in linux, and team viewer works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Shouldn't be an issue for them to check on every other computer.

"Hi there,

So, as a bit of a background, I work in a central IT department that is technically classified to deal with high-risk data, and I'm an endpoint manager, meaning I'm ""OfficeIT"" in your case. 

At our org, we offer both Windows and Mac as choices for staff machines. While IBM figures they save $500 over the lifetime of a Mac versus a Windows PC (including licenses and FTE time), IBM also has the money to throw at specialized solutions for each platform to make that happen. And I will say, as a primarily Mac centric employee, I think they're a superior work device both from a management point of view and from a developer point of view. Maybe you wouldn't buy one yourself, but with DEP and a proper MDM, deloyment and management is easy as piss and the OS is rock-solid (hardware...meh, we've been lucky with the keyboard issues on the MBPs so far). Linus is cool and all, but I much prefer to just spin up a CentOS VM in our datacenter, or locally through VMWare Fusion than actually work in it all day. Almost every single one of our devs uses a Mac, managed by me with Jamf, and it honestly takes up a very small amount of my time. It takes me the same amount of time to deploy a single Macbook as it does an order of 500 iMacs, which is to say, about 2 minutes of clicking. 

But what I can say is this. IT Security is a hybrid of both IT and HR. I can do my best to secure my fleet of Macs, ensure they're up to date, encrypted, and so on, but ultimately, I'm handing over a computer to someone. If they have physical, day to day access, I assume that people will try and succeed in breaking shit, or doing things that are against policy. My job isn't to herd those cats, or be the police. I hand out managed tools to make people's jobs easier, and if they break them, then they have to answer for it, not me.

Ultimately, the only thing I'd care about as far as Linux endpoints go is reporting. I'd want to know exactly what is installed, how it was installed, what the state of specific security policy compliance issues are (full disk encryption, desktop backups, password policies and LDAP configs). We recently had one developer who used Linux on his endpoint, and basically, we told him, we don't have the man-power or money to boot-strap a Linux management service, so you're on your own. Here is IT security policy, you need to be logging in with your LDAP creds, backup your shit with this software, encrypt your disk, and don't be stupid. Linux users are just de facto going to be more technical than your average graphic designer or accountant, they can probably easily handle these tasks on their own, and helpdesk calls are going to likely be zero, they'll try and fix everything themselves. 

So, I'd look into proper endpoint reporting, so when someone forgets their laptop at a coffee shop, OfficeIT can cover their asses and say ""look, it checked into our reporting server an hour before it went missing, and it is listed as encrypted, and backed up, so the company's data is safe"", and then HR/purchasing can deal with the employee for losing equipment (which is small fry to losing potentially protected data). After that, everything else is an HR problem. Draw up proper acceptable use policies and basically say that ""If you're going to use a Linux machine, we'll buy you one, and maybe set it up, but maintaining things, helpdesk stuff, all that, is on **you**"".

Or, more easily, without having to make this a political fight, simply tell OfficeIT that they can force Windows on everyone, but they need to purchase and deploy proper enterprise grade hypervisor applications to everyone's machines so that devs can have a proper dev environment to do their jobs in. Honestly, VMs are so so much easier than bare-metal anyways, because you can break shit all you want and just revert to snapshot.",1,0.7997122368112731

I don't think you'll get Helpdesk to support Linux, and I think formally pushing Desktop Linux in the environment will lead to them trying to abandon some of their responsibilities and warranties, claiming that there are now unmonitored hosts in the environments which makes it hard/impossible to properly manage in the future.

The Service Desk and Desktop Team has been recruited for and staffed by people with windows support experience and a bit of dabbling in macos. There may be linux enthusiasts there however it is not the job they signed on for and already spend all day fighting fires on. Enter Linux. Linux is managed differently, supported in a different way. It has a huge learning curve. It's more than Transitioning support for a particular application into the Service Catalogue. It's a a new OS, with different versions of existing applications - Libre Office is the best example OP cited.. not to mention the Linux version of X app, if available. The support staff will need to be trained on how to use all these things as well as simple Linux concepts. While OP opens the odd slideshow or spreadsheet, it doesn't mean it isn't a daily requirement for many. Would you want to receive a call along the lines of ""I'm collaborating with a colleague on windows and when we email the file back and forth making revisions we have formatting issues"" ? The Service Desk would need a budget for training, additional staff as their Service Catalogue just a lot bigger.

There'd be proxy issues from Windows users having collaboration problems with Linux users. Not to mention printing.. Oy Vey.

The truth is that there are no *direct* cost-savings from getting rid of Windows on the desktop in organizations already using it at scale, especially if you're using OEM licenses. The direct cost savings only come from getting rid of the large number of ancillary servers and services that accumulate: AD-DCs, WSUS, MDT, SCCM, Exchange, IIS, RDS/TS, MSSQL, Sharepoint, Lync, and the CALs to go with them. 

I count six types of CALs that a client user/device might need, though Project Server CALs are probably rare, and I've mostly seen Sharepoint CALs tossed in as a bundle. I've heard of Sharepoint CAL prices getting expensive after a enterprise decides to implement it to use the ""free"" bundled licenses, though.

"My opinion is that the very things that we Linux users love about our platform are the same things that have prevented it from becoming a real contender as a viable desktop alternative to Windows or macOS.  The OP is absolutely right in that Linux is all about choice.  Unfortunately that choice has splintered Linux into 300 active distributions.  There are now at least 18 desktop environments.  There are over 40 music players alone to choose from.  There are even more than 20 sys init systems.  The choices go on and on and forks, which can be done by any person or group add even more confusion.  Can you imagine trying to manage a help desk for mainstream Linux users who are lay people who purchased a computer running Linux pre-installed?  It would be a nightmare!  Sure there are some hardware vendors who ship Linux systems but those are aimed for developers and Linux geeks like us, not for mom and dad.

&#x200B;

Our best hope for Linux on the desktop is for Microsoft to eventually release its own Linux distribution.  It would really be a win-win for Microsoft because it could release its version of Linux with a desktop environment that would be nearly indistinguishable from modern Windows 10 which would make it easier for mainstream Windows users to adopt.  Microsoft wouldn't have to worry about quality control or upgrade disasters because the open source community would continue to maintain and update the underlying packages of the system.  Microsoft could even make a substantial code donation to the WINE project which would ensure backward compatibility with existing Windows software.  Microsoft seems to be slowly inching its way towards this outcome.  Incorporating a full linux kernel into WSL 2 is one step in the right direction.",1,0.6556533148226054

&#x200B;

Apple recently announced that there will be no OS installed on their hardware other than MacOS. They then announced that new Mac hardware will be checking to make sure that all hardware is authorized by Mac and that only Mac authorized repair centers are able to fix Mac gear. This takes the form of a auth code that needs to be entered by the service facility. Failure of this code or unauthorized repairs may BRICK your device. The simple act of replacing your HDD or RAM may junk your machine.

Now look at the iPhone. If Apple decides that they don't agree with an app they can remove it from your phone. Now imagine that is extended to your PC. You want GIMP? Too bad - buy Photoshop. You installed Chrome - Safari is now the only browser authorized. It wouldn't take much to make it happen and the walled garden approach protects the average user. 

The next logical step is ""software as a service"". Nothing gets installed and you pay yearly for every app. Because you can't do anything without risking bricking your machine you are trapped.

"As you mention DTube, I must advice people to not waste their time on it. I started uploading there just to see my videos stop working within a month. This is because despite the D for decentralised, it's not actually decentralised.

Your videos are stored on DTubes servers, they store it for a week and then take a cut of your rewards to pay for further storage. In other words, if you don't get a lot of rewards, your videos will simply go into an endless loading loop.

It should be possible to put up your own ipfs node so you can store your own videos, but after looking into it I couldn't figure out how. I'd say this is not feasible for most people.

I find [LBRY](https://api.lbry.com/user/refer?r=3kQu1oESt3X91whKCJgJqCaT9GV6RW23) to be a far better alternative to YouTube as it's *actually* decentralised. You download and install the app from their website linked above and this is now basically a BitTorrent client. You publish your video, or song, or whatever (it supports other formats than videos) and then you basically seed your own content in a true decentralised fashion.

That being said, LBRY has reflector servers that download and seed your content for when your computer/LBRY app is not running.

You can also put a price on your content and get 100% of the proceeds (minus a small transaction fee), or people can tip you if you put your content up for free.

It's still in beta, so a bit rough around the edges and lacking some features (no comments section yet, no live streaming yet, etc). But I think this one has the most potential out of all the alternatives. I've basically looked into/tried them all, DTube, BitChute, BitTube, PeerTube, Alexandria, you name it.

"As an Nvidia Optimus user on Linux, my short advice: Go AMD!",0,0.2969094402202095
"> Can someone please give me a straight answer on the AMD open source driver? Is it less performant than their closed source driver, but still good, or does it actually perform on par with the AMD closed source driver?

Performance is on par or better in the open-source driver, to the point that AMD has recommended the open-source driver for general purposes and gaming for around a year now. Basically, it's just professional applications with a strict compatibility matrix that should be using the AMDGPU-PRO binary driver for new deployments, now.

Features-wise, the open-source driver was slightly lagging in a couple of things: OpenCL, FreeSync, HDMI Audio, and slightly in Vulkan (RADV vs. AMDVLK), but the open-source driver is very close in feature-parity now. The only feature that might lead someone to use the PRO driver would be OpenCL, and even then there's a way to combine the PRO OpenCL with the open-source driver.

The bottom line is that Nvidia's Linux support today is very much the same as it was ten years ago, as it was fifteen years ago, more -- quite good. So is Intel's (open-source) support, for that matter -- just the same as it always was. What's changed is that after an extended effort, AMD has gone from an inferior closed-source driver far behind Nvidia, to an open-source driver that's at least equal to Nvidia and [quite literally getting better every day](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_topic&q=Radeon).",0,0.04605297970488893

sigh... There is a good reason to put full chips in laptops. You can have more performance at a much lower clock. In notebooks, large issue with performance isnt the chip. It the amount of memory lanes you can put without breaking your power budget.

To give you an idea, Nvidia blocked Intel/AMD collaboration because HBM was competitor or better than Nvidia  compression/tile tricks. Kaby-G benchmarks shows as much performance as 1050 with less power.

It rolls in a smidge costlier than the Sager/Clevo I posted previously -- OTOH it's an IPS display and solid aluminum chassis.

I have had a really hard time finding any reviews about it though.  Apparently until just a few days ago, you couldn't get the 9th Gen i7 and RTX 2080 - so even reviews from a week ago are looking at somewhat different specs.

I don't see anything there that jumps out at me as likely to be a compatibility issue.  I still haven't googled to see if there are any particular issues with that CPU, but my understanding is that it's just the 8th gen version with 2 more cores, so I'm guessing it should be safe.

If we remove cost (I'm still pretending no budget) can you think of any reason to strike this one from the list?  I really like my Sager/Clevo, and it has held up for 8 years, but even new it wasn't winning any awards regarding feeling really solid or well put together.  The Dell seems likely to have at least as high an actual build quality, and significantly higher perception of build quality.  The reviews I've seen which at least include the 2019 chassis all seem pretty impressed with build quality, and one guy was stunned at how good the (lack of) panel bleed was.

"I don't really know, if its better. Here in germany, health insurance, social insurance, etc are paid by you (me) and your company. How much you have to pay depends on your monthly incomings. Health insurance - for example - is at around 14% of your monthly incomings. But you just have to pay half of it and the other half is paid by the company you work for. So 7% for me and 7% for my boss. The fees and taxes I have to pay are taken from my incomings by the company I work for. They pay it - together with their part of it - directly to goverment and insurances. So when my money arrives at my bank account, those taxes and fees are already paid.

Whenever I need a doctor, I just go there. I hand over my insurance card and thats it. No extra fees or payments. When I need some medicine, most of it is covered by health insurance as well. You do have to pay a small fee, but thats like $7 I guess. And once your payments for medicine reach 2% of your annual incomings, you are free of those payments for the rest of the year. In case you are chronically ill, you don't even have to pay those 2%. All I have to buy and pay myself are things like mild painkillers, nasal spray, etc. But they are cheap here. 

German law says, that your company has to pay you for up to 6 weeks, even you are not working. So even you are sick for a month, you will get your regular payment (except bonus payments like when you work on sunday). After those 6 weeks, your health insurance will pay you. You will get 70% of your regular incoming for a maximum of 78 weeks.

If you have the means and the price isn’t outrageously higher consider the difference as an educational fee.  I own a System 76 Oryx from a couple of years ago.  I could have paid less, but it would have taken a number of hours to identify and configure a competing product.  I value my time.       My time was worth much more than the difference in price.  I also wanted to support a real Linux vendor.  So to me, any additional cost was essentially a donation to what I believe to be a worthy endeavor and if it had turned out to be a bad purchase I would then have learned something that wanted to know.

"I'm running a system76 box coming from a Lenovo right before. TBH with the exception of a wifi-thing from 16.04, Ubuntu on lenovo runs just about as well as Pos\_Os! System76.

With System76 though, everything *just works.* Pop\_os! is wonderful, great customization (once I got rid of gnome3), and works swimmingly as a daily driver. I can honestly say I am manifold more productive than I ever was on windows, although, for your purposes that might not mean much.

In short, I would seriously consider it just for the support (which I've never needed but its part of the deal), and the fact that the machine is basically guaranteed to run linux well.

">  I hate the fact that even reviews barely mention them

Taste is subjective and it's not common that a reviewer can say anything particularly positive about input devices, so coverage is deliberately limited. The typical consumer doesn't have nearly as wide of a range of experience with different keyboards/trackpads as a reviewer or computing professional, so frankly most of them don't know what they would be missing.

People don't like negativity in general, and there are commercial and advertising reasons why reviews are very rarely going to lambaste a product. The readers are going to tend to shop the ""speeds and feeds"" (spec numbers) anyway, so the reviewers are going to try to give them what they want. The reader wants to know things like ""is there any particular reason I shouldn't buy this attractive-seeming model with the attractive specs and the attractive price?""

Trackpads are the biggest reason why I prefer not to use laptops, but you just can't talk most people into desktops these days. They're just not willing to accept a mobility and size constriction for an advantage that's only theoretical to them. So they keep buying the laptops and attach displays, docks, keyboards, and all so ubiquitously, external mice.

Microsoft's ""Precision Touchpad"" hardware spec is trying to match Macs, now, though, and it seems like a good idea and very promising. Explicit coverage of it in the Linux world is nearly nonexistent, though. I believe a driver has been mainlined, but nobody every talks about it, so I don't know.

"Consider 4-finger left or right gesture for desktop switching. You put 4 fingers down on the touchpad, and start moving. What happens is that the desktop switcher actually triggers before your eyes while your fingers are still down on the touchpad. If you pause the movement, the desktop switching also stops. If I move fingers back, the gesture reverses and puts the old desktop back. It's not ""gesture"" at all in sense that it's something you complete and then it triggers and does something; the key thing is that on Apple, gestures are integrated into whatever window manager it has, and they all respond in real time while you're doing them, and interrupting your motion pauses the gesture.

It is fluid, continuous control, very intuitive, and basically the same smooth movement that you get with moving the pointer with a single finger, except using more fingers brings in ever grander concepts of ""moving"" something, until you have four and are moving entire desktops, just like you'd move a mouse pointer. On GNOME, I have a poor copy of this in that I do 4 finger swipe and then it triggers a switch. I can live with it, but on a macOS device I'd already be staring at the other desktop, while GNOME only just realized that I want to switch and starts animating the transition.

Inertia with scrolling is also available in every application. Neither Firefox nor Chrome can do it on Linux. This is a big one, it's really annoying to scroll without inertia these days in the arguably two most important applications of the whole Linux desktop. I guess I'll try the GNOME browser on the new 19.04 Ubuntu just to see if it wouldn't suck as much to use as Firefox and Chrome do right now.

There also used to be an issue with pixel perfect scrolling where you can scroll up, down or sideways by 1 px increments just by making a small 2-finger scroll motion. We got this now thanks to new Qt and GTK+3, so this is no longer really a point in favor of Apple. On Linux, scrolling used the be chunky, as in, you do the gesture and initially nothing moves until it has measured long enough motion, then it does a single mouse wheel click, and then application responds to that simulated event by moving up some 50 px at once. You could not scroll less than one mouse wheel click by using the touchpad gesture. This got fixed fairly recently, I remember looking into it a few years back and having to pass some random environment variables to make it kinda-sorta work.

Some personal history: I used to use Linux, and had mice in my laptop carry back because touchpads on neither windows nor Linux cut it. They were all so small and annoying to use, and the joystick nipple in middle of keyboard never really felt that nice to me, so mouse it was. Until I got my first Apple computer sometime in 2012 or so, and I soon realized I don't use the mouse anymore. Compared to the touchpad, it's just a cumbersome, slow and inaccurate device, needing to be dug out of the bag, connected, have a flat surface to operate on, and I don't think I could even use it as fast or as accurately as with the touchpad.

In my mental model of what it meant to be a mobile worker, I crossed over the one thing I always had to carry with me and plug in before I could get to work. I think it wasn't even the gestures, inertia scrolling or crap like that which made me love the touchpad. It was basically that the thing was physically big enough to allow reaching the other edge of the desktop with a single motion, and it didn't go overboard with acceleration so it was precise. It also helps that Apple has always had absolutely faultless palm/thumb detection so it literally never does an accidental click or pointer movement unless I actually have a finger tip on it and want to use it. It might just as well read my mind, it works that well.

"It's of course a very personal experience, most input devices comes down to what you feel is best and are used to.

Personally I've found linux touchpads to be pretty unpleasant to use, as someone who's spent a number of years on macbooks. I end up only really using a mouse on linux, which is a bit limiting. It has been a while since I used a Linux touchpad daily over a longer period of time though, so I can't speak for how they've improved lately.

It would be nice to know to what extent these feelings are personal vs objective. But it's hard to quantify.. There is http://mouseaccuracy.com which gets some of the way at least in measuring accuracy.. But if the trackpads works well but are poorly integrated into applications, it wouldn't measure that.

As a small test I ran mouseaccuracy.com a few times on a macbook, with settings 'Hard'/'Small'/30 seconds as the author of the article did and got similar results.. ~300 points, ~99% accuracy on the macbook, score dropped by half on my linux laptop where I only use the touchpad occasionally.

I'd be interested in seeing how someone who uses a linux touchpad frequently fares on the test, if any of you have a few minutes to spare! :)

edit: Found some people on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19485178 posting their results, and they seem fairly similar across the board.

Outside of native games, if you're willing to enable SteamPlay for all games on Steam, and check protondb before running a game, and potentially do some absolutely minimal tweaks to get a game to work then the number of games you can run on Linux is huge.

For example with a launch parameter tweak, I can play GTA Online on Mint, with a controller. That's my favourite game so I'm really happy that just works so easily. It runs almost flawlessly and at about 80% of the fps I was getting under Windows. I also play Elder Scrolls Online too, it runs without any tweaks, but sometimes the launcher freezes while opening. Close it and reopen and it works. Very minor problem and no issues in game, similar story with the performance too.

Definitely check out ProtonDB and see how many of your top 20 games are playable and to what degree.

I would say gaming on Linux is now good enough to dual boot and spend 95% of your time on Linux, unless a game you love is borked. Windows is still required for a few popular games. If a game doesn't run at all on Linux right now, overwhelmingly the reason is usually due to anticheat built into a game (common for many popular pvp online games) hence PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex, Fortnite, are all unplayable for now. But if you don't play those games then that isn't an issue.

So back to the example, under windows we say drawline, interpreting that drawline has to do drawline is probably faster than saying drawline, do that with linedraw in this manner. But anything that happens after can wildly vary between directx and vulkan which because it is the actual part that requires your pc to do a lot makes the far greater impact. This is of course simplified.

"> none of us really knows anything about Linux..

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",0,0.13376521487267204

Stallman and the GNU project are very interlinked so you can start here for a quick overview. You can read how Stallman funded the GNU project with selling paper manuals and tapes of code in the mail for $150 in the 80s. Yes, tapes...

https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html

You can also read the mindset in the 90s. When Microsoft had just gained control of 90% of the PC market and commercial unix systems dominated every mainframe in the world. You had to use activex, flash, and java applets to do work and their was a real fear that systems would be locked down with government mandated and standardized DRM.

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html

It sorta happened.... cablecard for example... we need a key from microsoft to boot many uefi bioses, but people are dropping cable and Linux has grown enough most vendors wouldn't dare lock Linux out. Governments have mandated certain proprietary apps. South Korea for example took forever to move off an activex applet.

Now a days, system usage is divided with the iOS, Android, Chromebooks and Windows. Linux is nothing in the desktop world, but it is everything in the server world. Android and ChromeOS are semi-free... with Google and hardware vendors contributing to many parts. In some ways, free software has really grown and dominates parts of the industry and in others it barely exists.",0,0.07805488431397638
"Sounds like a great idea, but as many have pointed out RMS != OSS.  He's all about Free Software which is often mixed with Open Source Software by saying FOSS - Free and Open Source Software.  The two can play well together but are mutually separate.  Comparing the two types of software is a great topic, so I could see dropping RMS and focusing on the differences of Free Software and Open Source Software.  If you do want to focus on RMS and Free Software  I highly recommend reading Free as in Freedom.  It's an AMAZING biography about RMS (Richard M Stallman) from 2002.  Another great resource is watching Revolution OS which is focused on Linux, but it does dip into the world of Free Software with some great quotes from RMS and Torvalds which tend to have a similar dynamic to Job and Gates.  There are so many great stories from this area of study, the dynamics are go very deep, and though Torvalds deserves amazing credit for Linux I think Stallman is often overlooked though one could say he's the grandfather of what we have as Linux today.

"You could do something with Emacs, since that's a program commonly associated with Stallman.

There are other a11y tools for other kinds of users I want to work on, like a nice magnifying glass tool (which should work better on Wayland than it does on X due to better hidpi support - I can double the DPI of the magnified region), high contrast and colorblind modes, mouse stabilization, and so on. I'd also like to make a nice accessible email client. If anyone has more ideas, I'd love to hear them.

With respect to Orca, I'd like to get better support for it on sway & wlroots, but I don't like its design and I'm a little bit headstrong, so I'm hoping that doing things like turning off my displays for days at a time will give me enough empathy to find novel new solutions even if they're not what you're used to.

"I'm a bit late, but I figured I'd add my thoughts as well. I'm totally blind and use Linux, though not on the desktop. I've tried many, many times to make that work for me, but it honestly just makes using my computer feel like pulling teeth. I don't mean to come off as if I'm just complaining for the sake of complaining so I won't list a whole bunch of examples, but for me personally, it just feels way too rough and buggy. By that I mean the entire accessibility stack, a lot of which is very old and hacky, but especially Orca in terminal windows and on the web (yes, there are console screen readers, but using them in conjunction with Xorg is cumbersome at best).

There are lots of applications that are just not written with accessibility in mind, which is the case on all platforms, but I'd say more so on Linux. I'm sorry I come off as so negative and I really am grateful for what we have, and part of me thinks I shouldn't even be complaining since Linux isn't my desktop platform, but having this topic come up at all is rare, so I figured I might as well.

Another big issue for me is TTS on Linux. The ""best"" (as in easiest to set up) option is ESpeak, which I just cannot listen to for long periods of time. That's a very unpopular opinion in blind Linux groups, and you'll often get shit on for stating it, but I mean, it's not trivial to ""just make your own"" synthesizer if you don't like it. [Here are some examples, if you're curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cziGpZTKZko).

There also seems to be a tendency to want to create separate Linux distributions that are accessible out of the box, usually meaning that they come up speaking when booted from a live environment. We don't need (yet another) Linux distro that does that; there are plenty of them already, and often there is a keyboard shortcut to activate the screen reader on mainstream ones, which someone inclined to try Linux for the first time would probably be able to figure out if they got as far as booting it. Again, I apologize for coming off as so negative. I really do love Linux. I have a few Linux servers and I'd say it's the OS I have the most knowledge of, internally. I'm even trying for a job in Linux administration, which I guess is kind of ironic since my ideal environment would be  interfacing with Linux servers via SSH on another platform.",1,0.836952937616286

"imho there is a serious misunderstanding of a11y in modern systems like wayland. im not an a11y developer, but i do just such systems. 

i use an a11y framework (dogtail) to do application test automation. however this is at odds with the concept of containerising applications. currently my tests only run on old vms, which are kept for this purpose. dogtail is broken under recent gtk systems, and i don't have a convenient way to bypass this and access other ui elements. 

there is no way, as a developer, that i can work independently of the windowing system developers to develop new and interesting ways to communicate through the user interface, or to link to other applications. one may go through very limited use cases, even if the user explicitly wishes to allow wider (less ""secure"") use.

-	the ones who aspire to be tinkerers/hackers/diy’ers/developpers... then later down the road want a system that they can personalize and optimize to their liking.

So the distribution of choice would have to cater to both populations.

It is the second example of a detached LUKS header, not the first one. I didn't notice my mistake until now.

In the example on the wiki `loop` is loaded as a module in the initramfs, so when you `cryptsetup open` the keyfile it actually creates a loop device because it is not a partition. It is similar to an encrypted container you would make with veracrypt or truecrypt.

In the custom encrypt hook you can see I just use `/dev/mapper/lukskey` directly, but if I wanted to I could create a filesystem and mount it after it has been decrypted with `cryptsetup open`

So for the `header.img` I would use the same method, either directly or with a filesystem.

I personally think compiz/emerald has nicer looking (and more) desktop effects and nicer looking window decoration themes. kwin does have some of the most important desktop effects (like wobbly windows), but no burn or dream effects, and no pointless drawing fire on the screen or fish tank cube or whatnot.

I was a in a similar situation last week. After upgrading my dedicated server, my server started to behave really strangely. It would freeze pretty hard and then I had to do hard reboot to recover.

The thing is I don't often reboot it and probably never noticed the cronjob until I rebooted the server.

So somehow someone got access to my server, installed his own public key in .ssh/authorized_keys and installed a cronjob that would boot proxy servers. I look at the file it was starting and inside the script it starts multiple times the same damn proxy server.

I changed password removed the cronjob and since then no more problems but it sounds to sloppy of a job. The thing that should have rang a bell is when I rebooted my server, my server got blocked for spamming by the hosting company. I dismissed this as I thought it was a client demo who went crazy trying to send mails to other clients as the server was rebooted but apparently it was my root account which was sending me spam because the cron job were failing.

If everyone could implement their own independent Isa on top of it, all we would be able to run would be the basic i486 instruction set as the common denominator,and developers would have to include every possible extra instruction Case per software.If they improve the cpu design, who would want to contribute back the chip design to the source? that would be suicide, when corporate has the option to keep it to themselves, they will, be assured.

I saw the tests. a stupid cortex a7 can run circles around it.
