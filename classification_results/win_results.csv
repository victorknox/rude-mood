"I see a lot of this, and I just wanted to throw in a comment. Just to get this out of my way, I run Windows 10 on my desktop and Arch Linux on my laptop. I'm comfortable on the command line, but I prefer GUI tools when it makes thing legitimately easier, which is a lot of the time. I'm not going to bash Windows, but I am a Linux and BSD fan. That having been said...

You're absolutely right - Linux isn't a Windows replacement, and people that say it is should stop. It *is* better in certain use cases like running servers or coding, but for most people if you're happy with what you've got, there's absolutely no reason to change.

That having been said, I don't understand what people are doing with their Linux installs to make it so damn hard. I have a CLI-oriented distribution, and I don't *have* to use CLI unless I want to 9 times out of ten. Installing software is usually a breeze, and I can easily find answers in the documentation more often than not.

As for security, you should run with your comfort level. My Arch laptop is significantly more secure than your Windows box if all you're running is Windows Defender, but your setup is probably fine for you. It's probably fine for 75% of users. If you're not opening strange attachments or perusing a bunch of porn or darkweb sites, you're probably going to be fine. Personally, I'm not comfortable with the amount of information Microsoft wants from me, and I perfer to be able to peruse source code. *But that's me*.

I guess the main thing I want to get across with this long, rambling response is that I use Linux all the time, and I don't see most of the issues you're talking about. You know what I had to do to install Zoom on my laptop? I typed `yay -S zoom` into my terminal. If I had a GUI package manager, like the one that comes with Mint, Manjaro, or, yes, Ubuntu, it would be even easier.

There's no need for all the hate, is me point. I don't know what went wrong on your end, but it's not typical. But if you're happy with Windows, I'm not sure why you're installing Linux in the first place. I have it on my laptop because I prefer it for connecting to unfamiliar WiFi networks and a couple other things. I use Windows on my desktop because it's better for gaming and I don't connect it to networks that I don't admin.",0,0.325987574529583

"I agree with you that 'Linux' users shouldn't force Windows users to switch. Here's the catch, first, they are right about Linux runs on everything (not to be confused with the GNU OS or GNU/Linux, which includes Ubuntu etc.). Hell, Android, Chrome OS, top 500 supercomputers, your refrigerator, TV, or almost every IoT devices runs on the Linux kernel (again, not to be confused with the GNU/Linux OS). Second, speaking about the drivers, Windows has the edge (no pun intended) it is preinstalled in your device so of course everything should work. GNU/Linux OS is just a third party OS backed by the community and some corporate, it is not guaranteed to fully work with your device which already comes with Windows preinstalled, but most of the time, all necessary parts of your computer should work with GNU/Linux. There are GNU/Linux laptops sold by Dell and Lenovo which will not have any problem as that OS is designed to run on that device.

IMO, the open-source community has better technical support than commercial one, they are more supportive. Another thing, Zoom can be installed just by going to a store, searching ‚Äúzoom‚Äù, pressing ‚Äúinstall‚Äù button, and shwalla you have Zoom installed. No need to press that icon at the button and agree. And it is safer since you don't have to go to the zoom website, your grandma might download zoom from a shady website. Another thing, you might have confused ‚Äúfree‚Äù with ‚Äúfree of charge‚Äù. Both GNU/Linux and Linux are free/libre and free of charge. It means that you are free to do anything, there's no proprietary things or company controlling you. There's no company telling you that stop what you are doing, it's time to update.

TL;DR Linux is not what you think. GNU/Linux (like Ubuntu) is different from the Linux kernel. Linux almost runs on everything. Windows is designed to work wonderfully in your device since its hardware is designed for Windows. Zoom is as easy to install as installing a software in the play store. The meaning of 'Free' isn't what you think.

"So I've been doing linux kernel dev since 95, and using desktop linux up until the advent of the end of around win 8.1. I switched to windows 10 as my main desktop and don't plan on ever looking back. 

I would not waste one second thinking about what /r/linux loonies say about linux being a windows replacement because it isn't, and ya grandma may like chrome in her linux desktop for the 2 things she uses it for, but she'd probably also be fine with any OS.. hell she could probably just live with a tablet or some other restricted form of computing.. 

Thinking about it, I would never give linux to my dad (he is not a computer power user)...because my dad likes all the amenities of an OS that can hit the resolutions of all the big ass monitors and tv's he buys and all the whacky devices he wants to attach to it not knowin what he's doing ..so funny. Anyway, supporting the drivers he'll need is more of a pain in the ass of having to occasionally wipe his machine of viruses (which hasn't happened really since windows 7). I also taught him a few simple safety practices.. LIKE DONT INSTALL THE GAMBLING CASINO GAME EXE

The fact is linux is not meant and never will be made for most end users unless a company makes it happen by changing most of what linux is today and once that happens the ""community"" will crap all over them, like the hate ubuntu gets these days. 

Honestly it would take a lot for me to want to use linux as a desktop again, and that company would have to be user focused, and for them to do the high level of work needed they'd probably need some heft compensation..  thenI'm right back to windows or mac. See the reality they don't want to accept is that windows or mac etc are the way they are because that's what it takes.

But will this ever translate to a mainstream Linux desktop? No. Canonical with Ubuntu is about as close as we will get, but even Canonical has to deal with upstream changes that will break it's design.

"Although I am in the same boat that I don't install linux for my non techie relatives, I think many people are applying the blame for setup issues on the wrong people.

It isn't that linux developers don't care about user experience (my laptop for example required 0 terminal commands to get everything working with kubuntu), but linux always faces an uphill battle with some hardware that the suppliers never tested with linux. If you hit a piece of hardware that has poor support for linux, then you will face some difficulties, and will require greater than average skill with computers to get it working.

This is the same though for windows. I recently hit a compatibility issue with some hardware, and had to do some digging in device manager, and manually finding and installing drivers to get it to work.

The thing is you rarely encounter these problems with windows, as computers are almost always sold with windows installed, and so are tested to make sure all the drivers are installed correctly.

"I've been using Linux on all of my machines since 2003 and I haven't had any major issues with it.  I became disillusioned with Windows when XP debuted with 'Product Activation' which I didn't like.  I don't miss Windows at all and there is nothing that I can't do on Linux that I could do in Windows.  

Over the years, I've installed Linux on a multitude of laptops, desktops and servers without any major issues, including state of the art modern hardware of all types.  I've also used Linux with dozens of printers, scanners and other peripherals with little effort.  

Linux offers a wealth of desktop environments and an almost overwhelming abundance of free and open source software for every need.  Much like at Burger King...you can have it your way!  Its open nature allows for frequent innovations and rapid fixes for bugs.  I have never needed customer service because most Linux distros have thriving and vibrant communities of friendly users who are always willing to help troubleshoot issues.  I'm also the type of person who is willing to learn how to solve issues on my own through research and collaboration with other users instead of simply posting ""My system isn't working!  Help!!!""  As a result, I've managed to become very adept at using Linux to its fullest potential over the years.  

Back in 2004 I installed Linux Mint on my elderly father's computer because his XP system kept getting infected by malware.  I configured everything just the way he had it on his Windows system and he used that computer for years without any problems, up until he died in 2008.

So, I'm really sorry that you've had such a poor experience with Linux via your brief perusal of Ubuntu.

"I'm a heavy power user and enthusiast myself and the thing is, Linux is more of a secondary tool for me when I need it. I will use it in a VM when I need the full deal, and when I need just a terminal to run something simple I use Windows Subsystem for Linux. Windows is easier to figure out (incl. the advanced things) and honestly the command prompt is easier to use than a Linux terminal (maybe this is just because before I used to used it more often in modern Windows I used to play a ton with DOS w/ Windows 3.1 and the underlying DOS on Win9x which all use basically the same commands as modern text-mode Windows NT 10.0 aka Windows 10). Another thing on Windows is that most of the advanced/geeky options can be accessed through the GUI and all you have to know is how to use said options and not how to waste time finding them through a terminal. Linux is open source, and somebody could and should take the good stuff from Windows and COMBINE it with Linux to make great OS for everyday use. Despite all of the downsides, Linux does have some pretty big uses. One notable things is the Tails distribution. It runs off a USB stick and lets you browse the internet anonymously with Tor without leaving any evidence on your computer or the boot USB stick. Love this stuff when I feel the need to be invisible from time to time. Sadly the WiFi support only works on my laptop's Intel 9560 adapter, but not on my gaming desktop's Realtek RTL8821CE which for some reason has ZERO Linux support. How did I fix this? I connected a spare Android phone to WiFi, then plugged it into the computer and used the ""USB Tethering"" option which takes the phone's current internet connection and shares it to the connected computer via an emulated generic NDIS ethernet adapter.",0,0.23743909124399104
"There isn‚Äôt customer support with linux, and while it runs on almost any machine it doesn‚Äôt support all devices (the manufacturer has to write a driver like they did for windows and many don‚Äôt deem it worth the effort). Some wifi bluetooth chipset vendors are a common pain and graphics cards often lag on support and updates. Software support is also a lot less common and the only big exception to this is Steam pushing to support gaming on linux and using a few tricks that attempt to port games over.

But with linux it‚Äôs often much easier to learn how everything works (if you actually want to) and if you ask for help online you‚Äôre more likely to get an explanation for what is broken and how to fix it than you are a canned response that has no relation to the issue at hand.

I‚Äôve personally found linux to be far more reliable and have only ever broken it by uninstalling system components that use python. I‚Äôve had to bang at windows every now and again to keep everything running smoothly.

While most things that can be done in the terminal have a graphical counterpart there are two issues.
First it‚Äôs often simpler to give a terminal command if you know what you‚Äôre doing. Copy paste this it will ask for your password vs open that click this, click that, click yes ... . The second is consistency or rather lack thereof, If you run windows I know you have notepad and with linux they can likely assume that pretty much every system has a vi or similar installation but linux is based very much on choice and while one person might have gedit installed by default another might have kate. Personally I use Linux Mint and as I recall the text editor is currently xed. As far as I know all of these, combined with the respective file managers, have some way of graphically opening a file with admin privileges and never opening the terminal. But the buttons to do so are often hidden away and again you sit with copy paste ‚Äúsudo xed <filename>‚Äù because it‚Äôs far less effort to explain.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend switching unless you were stuck with an unsupported windows version but if you are able to run both (on separate devices) or have some idea of what linux can and can‚Äôt do before you switch over it‚Äôs an option that‚Äôs out there.

Personally I got to using it because I had to use it for a programming course and liked the workspaces functionality a lot at the time (windows would later add ‚Äúdesktops‚Äù). Then my hard drive died a year later (I could still use it but it was slow and starting to give a whole bunch of other problems as a result) and the only machine in the house I could use while we got it replaced was an abandoned and unsupported vista laptop. Vista was still supported but not that version so I couldn‚Äôt update it and opening the antivirus for the first time in a few years was like watching paint dry. I downloaded ubuntu and linux mint on my slowly dying laptop and decided I liked Mint better because it had a windows 7/xp like feel to the desktop interface at the time and I felt more comfortable using it.

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

No, Linux isn't for everyone. The main issue is that most people have hardware that requires Windows. Why? you may ask:

If you have an NVIDIA video card, forget it. Video output is garbage.

Have anything other than an HP print device? Forget it.

Have a modern notebook or laptop PC? Forget it. These devices are optimized for video and power, and 802.11x in such a way that they need closed source Windows software to run within reasonable limits.

I run manjaro, and I'm thrilled with it. That said:

I went out of my way to build a PC that would run linux comfortably. I avoided exotic hardware intentionally. I tried many distros before settlling down. Personally, I think Ubuntu is garbage for many of the reasons you described. 

The first thing an operating system should do besides drive core hardware is to provide a simple interface for adding and removing applications (any available application) The repository system as designed by most distros is a joke, having to connect random locations into a repository directory and scanning them repeatedly, and you have to pray that the repos don't die. The Arch User Repository is great, its a one click setup, quite literally, and you can select whatever items you want, and off you go. The fact that all package managers don't emulate this concept is certifiably insane.

As for the complaints about support, my experience was similar until I actually read and understood the ArchWiki and manjaro forums. There are good (and bad) videos out there too.

I use windows in a VM at work for some compatability with our systems. But linux also makes a lot of things MUCH easier. The terminal is an incredibly powerful tool if you know how to use it. Text manipulation, making automation with small bash scripts or just coding directly in the terminal. You don't need all sorts of different software to do simple stuff like formatting your text files or other tedious tasks.


I can spend 5 minutes and have a small script ready to read all images on a website and download those files to a folder. Doing that in windows you would download a plugin for your browser filled with features and stuff you do not need and the fiddle around with it until it works.



Also updates, windows still has to reboot just to apply updates, why? Because the systemfiles cannot be changed while in use. It's awful design under the hood.


Windows is nice for your gram gram. But if you spend a bit of time learning to use the terminal it is so powerful you could not live without it.

"As a complete newb on Linux, here's my two cents.

My first time using Linux was in early 2000s, in school. We had a single computer double booting Windows XP and Caixa M√°gica (a distro made specifically for portuguese schools, but nobody was teaching on it anyway) and as a bonus for being the best students in our basic IT classes, me and two others got to play around with Linux. We were amazed. We also crashed it pretty quickly and the fun was over.

A few years later, I got a school computer (150‚Ç¨ computer for poor kids), a Toshiba brick running the worst OS in existance - windows vista. I upgraded it slowly and lasted a long time until my Masters but one day, Vista just didn't start. Sometimes started and it just clogged out all the amazing 3Gb of ram that I could run in my PC. Most days it just didn't start. I didn't have any booting CDs, I had nothing, so no chance at getting the PC back after days and days of trying.

So my only chance was going with something free/open , lightweight, that I could boot from a USB. So I used all my limited internet access to download a LiveUSB for Ubuntu, the first distro that came around in google. I was immediately sold. Other than being a techie fan, I had zero experience with programming (cofcof css and html don't count), with linux language, with terminals (other than a few bits and bops of cmd and forensic computing in windows). I actually still don't know much.But I was HYPED. For the first time, I could actually get multiple desktops (sure, I get it, windows 10, you also have it now, like 8 years later), I could get key shortcuts for everything imaginable, I could get my actual screen resolution on the computer, I still had access to Office and all the software from my Masters, I loved it. I had zero problems with Ubuntu, I loved the sideways default taskbar (which now I port to all my Windows computers), I started getting involved in more terminal stuff, learning commands, finding a lot of helpful resources in the community and solving all my few issues by copy pasting from forums.

&#x200B;

And also came a very unexpected pro point. When I got into computational chemistry, suddenly we had to use Linux in the school computers to run simulations and send it to the cluster server. Nobody knew how to even navigate around Linux and for some odd reason people can't see it as a regular OS and just use the bloody GUI, they just panic?? So some people tried to use their Macs and Windows to do the job; the simulator didn't work that well and also... how did they communicate with the cluster? On Linux was easy, run the terminal, one or two lines and you are in. Now, Mac and Windows required a frick ton of added software and then still use their command lines to even send stuff down the cluster. Everyone ended up mailing me their work and having me upload to the cluster and download the results. I was seriously flexing even virtually running Debian on my android tablet and getting my results from the cluster faster than everyone (it had a waitlist, so). Does using linux once just make you a tech wiz? No it doesn't, but somehow people just randomly freak out at Linux. Eventually we also came to use Red Hat in the labs and once again, people were dumbfounded and I still don't understand why. Is this what people feel when they shift between Iphones and Androids?

Later on I got a new computer. Microsoft 8.1 (ew). Before it got stolen, I got to learn Linux better, got into basic white-hacking and forensics, so Kali Linux was my go to. The more I delved into Linux, the more I liked it. Kali also found its way to my tablet once again.

Now, Win10 has a lot of features that I liked in Ubuntu. I have a corporation PC, where I can't even run a LiveUSB without setting off the freaking BitLocker (and admins aren't giving me the codes for it either way), so I'm stuck with Win10 and a Virtual Machine Kali. I now do a lot of cartography with massive datasets and it would be unthinkable to run QGIS inside a virtual machine (16Gb clearly ain't enough already on a Windows boot), but I think it would be much better on Linux... just not dual booting it. For once, installing packages on Windows for QGIS absolutely SUCKS, linux filesystem is faster which better for QGIS, the integration with python on linux takes so muuuuch trouble out of doing anything with QGIS...

Would I give my grandma a computer with Linux? Considering that she knows absolute 0 about computers and would just use a browser and a word editor, yes, I would!

Put Ubuntu or Mint in it, because I could fetch an older/slower machine and make it work more smoothly than any Windows ever could. Also, no nasty notifications that Win10 insists in shooting at you, no random restarts to install some background software that you didn't know you had laying around, no weird stuff where once change in a setting suddenly triggers cortana and three monsters out of hell, no losing internet because the adapter decided that it is time for an update that you need to manually accept even though you set all updates into automatic mode, no bugging you to get logged on. I mean, I could go on about windows pet peeves. (And HP Bloatware. Jesus christ, HP bloatware is the worst. Main thing I love about Linux - and also rooted android - not freaking bloatware, I just get the software that I WANT AND NEED, not 100 apps that I'll never use but keep shouting things at me in my screen... usually that they are not working, like Phonewise, or Sure Click).

Linux does what you ask of it, and only that. Ask naught, get naught. Ask crap, get crap. So for a complete, absolute begginer, I would still have them use Linux instead of Windows. No surprises after someone else sets the computer up for them.",0,0.17990720153099707

"This is the most ""absolute pile of garbage"" post I've ever come across in this sub. I've installed Linux on like 6 laptops ranging from 2009 to 2019 laptops and I've never had issues with Wifi. In fact, Windows 10 decides to randomly drop the connection and not showing any networks until I run the troubleshooter on one of my laptops which isn't fun when it happens all the time. Linux didn't suffer from that. Now I'm not saying that this problem doesn't exist but the fact that wifi works outta the box on all the different laptops from different OEMs and different time periods tells me that your situation is the exception rather than the rule. Blame your wifi adapter manufacturer for it.




Also, what's so extremely hard with reading a tutorial that tells you exactly what you should edit in the config files? I'm not a terminal elitist and I'll take a GUI any day of the week but if you're too lazy to add 3 lines to a config file then forget about it for good then yeah stay with Windows. To answer your next question, most tutorials use the terminal because unlike Windows, Linux is highly customizable and there are a bunch of DEs and WMs for it that have different GUIs (which is excellent because that gives you choice). It makes all the sense in the world for tutorials to give you terminal commands that you can just paste and hit enter on them rather than making you cycle through GUIs. It makes things way easier let alone quicker and trust me, the terminal won't bite you. 




Compatibility wise, I've never ran into problems, not even with Nvidia GPUs but I do know that some specialized peripherals don't work so you have a valid point. It's worth mentioning that this is not a Linux limitation but it's rather a lazy developer problem but that changes nothing.





""Linux is an enthusiast OS"" is another bullshit argument. It's a totally different OS so you shouldn't expect things to work exactly like Windows which is the mistake most people make.





Speaking of Linux breaking, you don't hear it mentioned because it never breaks on its own. I've run rolling release distros which are the most ""unstable"". My installation broke only once because I fucked up with something I had no clue about. It doesn't nuke itself with updates like Windows does. Also, do you know that you can make scheduled backups with Timeshift? And no, it isn't worthless like the system restore in Windows. It backs up everything including your program configs so when you nuke your installation by fucking around with stuff you don't know, it's as simple as booting into a live environment, run Timeshift and hit a button. There you go, your system and data are back just like before you fucked up. Is there something as easy to fix Windows when it breaks itself with updates? I'd love to know because I still run it for my games.





Let's get to installing programs. You tell me what's easier, cycling through websites to look for the executable to install it or just hitting the ""install"" button in your software center? Because the latter is how things work in Linux and I have no idea what you're talking about with program installations.





""Windows is secure""? I have no words. That said, you'll be mostly fine if you know which download button to hit in the webpage that you need to grab your executable from to install your programs.. assuming you're on the right webpage. Sure hitting a download button in your software center is way harder and less secure than cycling your through webpages that have 5 download buttons only one of which is real. /s





As for privacy, it's up to you. I switched to Linux because it works as expected. When I type something in search, I get what I'm looking for and not random Bing search results instead of the program I'm tryna launch. Privacy doesn't exist nowadays because there are a million other things tracking you than Windows.

Your problem is similar to my other laptop which has its wifi not working as it should in Windows. Do I say Windows is trash with wifi just because I had a problem with one adapter? No. The same goes for Linux here.




If you don't want to spend 5 minutes inside a text editor for one time in your life then by all means, don't use Linux. If it doesn't fit you then it's pretty logical not to use it. You just can't shit on it because you don't like it and not because it's objectively bad. Many people will happily spend 5 minutes editing config files when they install it and have it work for good instead of dealing with an OS that you have zero control over it and installs stuff behind your back.





Guess what's another OS(es) that people move to all the time and are increasing im market share? Linux distros. I'm one of those people in case you say they don't exist.




Yeah, let's talk about the Microsoft Store and specifically Zoom. My sister wanted me to install Zoom on her laptop. I went to the MS Store, found it, hit the download button aaaand...it did nothing. After half an hour of hopeless troubleshooting I gave up and made a browser shortcut for her. Aside from these issues, the MS Store has only a handful of ""apps"". Let's try something most people use, Chrome. Can you find it on the MS Store? Nope. Can you find it on any PM in a Linux distro? Yup. I don't use Ubuntu myself specifically because of PPAs that you have to add every time you want to install something that isn't in the official Ubuntu repos. I use Pamac with Manjaro and everything is just there. You just hit the install button and it does everything for you. No need for terminal.




So you're telling me I see ads on FREE Windows program download pages because I pirate free programs? Okay. Linux doesn't lack productivity software. Libre Office became my first choice after trying it on Linux that I now install it on my Windows installations even though I have a MS Office key. Linux has no shortage of great software, you're only screwed if you use Adobe or MS Office and can't see yourself replacing them with the available FOSS alternatives that are just as powerful in which case you should probably stay away from Linux.





I'm not saying that everyone must use Linux because everyone has different needs and value certain aspects more than others. I'm an example of that. I have 2 SSDs in my laptop. I use Windows on one SSD for games where Linux isn't as good and use Linux on the other SSD for everything else because I find it way more reliable and easier to use.

Some examples: Mac OS and Linux can behave differently with scripting, despite both using BASH in the process. Could be due to environment, or due to called binaries and their presumed versions or capabilities.

Some distros like Ubuntu symlink and replace `sh` with `ash` which has broken some shell scripts.

I think a lot of the work going forward was just to make scripts themselves more bulletproof and to make fewer assumptions, really.

Next, reseat the processor, remove and readd ram.

On your spare machine create a Linux bootable thumb drive. Test that you see it as an option from your other machine and can boot it.

Work to try and not that thumb drive on the broken PC, legacy boot, legacy BIOS, not secure boot or uefi.

If the PC doesn't get to the loader something with the main board could be the cause.  

Remove the ram, see if you get a memory faulty beep code, if not, I'd suspect CPU needs another reseat.

Disconnect everything from the motherboard leave only fan for CPU, no hard drives, no cd or DVD, no usb front panel connections, as minimalist as possible, again with ram out trying force a beep code.

As an overview:

-	The Services Host service (svchost) used to group logical groups of processes together. 
-	in Windows 10 1703, they rejigged it so each system process **runs in its own svchost** process on all systems with more than 3.5GB RAM installed. 
-	this adds many benefits such as increased system resilience, better responsiveness, increased security between system processes, better scalability, and better resource management. 
-	windows 10 will *always* prefer user applications and will attempt to shift anything unneeded over into the paging file to free up as much memory as possible for your applications.

"> Quick skim suggests that photoshop doesn't have auto-save/auto-recovery enabled by default

Not going to down-vote you, just letting you know that's incorrect. Implemented in Photoshop CS6 and later, it *is enabled by default*, and always has been. It's Auto recovery. A temporary file is written to every 5 minutes in user AppData/Roaming on Windows. If the application closes/crashes without prompting the user to save or discard, the recovery feature will kick in on next launch and load the file. I've personally been saved by this feature countless times over the years. If you wish, you can install Photoshop and find it is enabled by default without you having to change anything.

https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/auto-recover-files-in-photoshop/

Did you check services.msc and see if it is still in there? My laptop has had issues with the RST service before.

And final words would be that If it were my own computer, I would backup all my important files and do a clean install of the 1903 via USB. In most cases, this could be faster and more efficient and by best practices, all your data should be backed up anyway.

Please don't shoot the messenger. I'm only sharing what I personally would do. I always keep a backup of all of my data.",1,0.7923694163908862
"Looks okay so far. So what happens is that the installer checks for the Intel RST driver by looking in the typical driver folder and scanning for specific file names. My laptop in particular does use RST. However despite me updating it to the latest version, the installer didn't let it work. It turns out that the installer was checking for a specific driver that Intel RST doesn't use (at least it doesn't use it on my computer). The screenshot you took proves that your computer has not loaded the driver , therefore meaning it doesn't need it to run. On my computer, it loaded iastoreac.sys while the installer was checking for **iastora.sys**. That single letter difference is crucial. The Intel RST drivers don't update that specific driver for some reason, causing the installer to see that it is still out of date despite going through the proper methods.

So here's what I did. **Please make a backup or restore point before you proceed**

1. Navigate to C://Windows/System32
2. In the toolbar, search for a driver titled **iastora.sys** 
3. Once Windows searches the System32 folder, locate iastor.sys
4. Rename it to iastor.bak
5. Do a reboot
6. Go to Windows update and restart the installation.

That's what worked for me. I did have Intel RST, but for some reason, the update direct from Intel did not touch the specific file the installer looked for. Since DriverView did not see that it was loaded into the system during use, I was 85% confident that renaming the file to something the installer wouldn't detect would not crash the system and let the installer run.

"Thank you for the thorough play by play, that is very helpful. 

Yes you are absolutely looking at some sort of hardware issue. The only BIOS settings that could cause anything like this would be over/under volting your CPU or RAM to the point that they're unstable. That would have been done manually at some point in the past, so assuming you haven't changed the default voltages your best bet is probably component isolation. While you were in the BIOS, did you perhaps get a chance to check the temperatures? It could be that something is overheating, or that a temperature sensor is malfunctioning.

Component isolation is exactly what it sounds like. First disconnect all non essential hardware like hard drives/SSDs, optical drives, graphics card, and any other peripherals internal and external (e.g. Wifi cards, USB hubs, etc.). Leave only CPU, RAM, PSU, keyboard and mouse connected. If the problem still happens, take one sick of RAM out and retest. If it still happens, swap the sticks and retest.

After all of that, if the problem still happens, the issue is either with the motherboard, CPU, or PSU. If the problem doesn't occur at any stage during this testing, add hardware back one by one, retesting each time until the problem returns. At that point you'll know which component is causing the issue.

Also, if you haven't tried reseating the graphics card yet, it might be worth starting with that just in case it's something simple like that. Especially because the original errors Windows was reporting were related to your graphics card.",1,0.8409654032300155

"My first guess is that your PSU  is faulty though the voltages seem to be OK. What peripheral devices do you have connected to your system ? Try to unplug everything that is not requited for your system to operate properly. For example leave only 1 RAM stick plugged and disconnect all of the system fans, if you have a DVD drive or additional HDD/SSD, disconnect that too and unplug every USB device beside your mouse and keyboard. Leave your system running for some time and see whats happening in this case. If it still fails try to take out your VGA too, you have Integrated Graphics available on your motherboard so you still can have video output without your NVIDIA card.

I think BIOS flash might fix your problem but to do that you must be sure that your system wont fail randomly. Some motherboards have second BIOS chip to recover from when the system fails but I don't know about ASRock, You can leave your PC on in BIOS screen to see whether it's crashing or not and then perform ""Instant Flash"" aka flashing new bios right from inside the bios ui:  Here is official guide for your motherboard [https://www.asrock.com/support/BIOSIG.asp?cat=BIOS8](https://www.asrock.com/support/BIOSIG.asp?cat=BIOS8)

"As others have noted, do the usual full re-install of all graphics drivers.

I had a similar issue a few years back: 2 displays in the GPU, 1 display on the iGPU. I am *not* saying this is necessarily your issue, as I can't do the research right now. This was on a iGPU far older than yours. 

BUT, ultimately the issue I had revolved around the fact the CPU/iGPU driver model for the display outputs was running on the WDDM (Windows Display Driver Model) 1.x model, while the GPU drivers were running on the WDDM 2.x model. Windows 10 does NOT allow both driver display models to be running concurrently.

I think his point is that the reason your computer isn't working properly is because it's missing drivers.

Your WiFi drivers will be on that disc for sure if the wifi is built into the motherboard. Same if you're using integrated graphics and not a gpu. Fix the WiFi using the disc from the mobo and then Windows will likely update most other missing drivings (not necessarily all). It will more than likely fix the video on it's own once connected but if it doesn't go to your video cards manufactures website, look for a support or drivers option, look for your card in the list provided, and then download that driver.",0,0.46106893677948413

I have a $1000 MS Nokia Windows Phone that was less than a year old before MS decided to stop doing Nokia Windows phones. The phone is useless due to poor design: it cannot be upgraded or have any apps due to IE6 being baked in.

Somewhere in my drawer of defunct tech I never really got any use out compared to cost is a Zune player.

MS should stick to operating system and Office and leave the other stuff to the community; they don't have to open source, just let devs access some parts of the OS to make more robust apps and add-ons. We have other choices now and people are wising up to corporate practises of trying to be all things to all people before selling out and it's not working anymore.

Yes, you need a Antivirus Program. But Microsoft integrated their own solution to Windows and it's pretty good. So no worries about that.

You just shouldn't run every file from the internet and always check software for their trust.

You don't need todo anything to make windows faster. Just use it like it comes out of the box. Only configure things in the settings app. Never download an optimization tool or something else. There are some tweak tutorials for gamers (disabling services etc.) but these changes only have a small impact on performance.

And modern PCs are using ssds. You don't need to defregmant them. Only with old spinning hdds that no one should use anymore as primary hard disk. The need of defragmentation doesn't came from windows, it came from the hdd technique.

Windows is an out of the box experience. You just need to download drivers. But not as much as in the past years, because Windows can handle now much more on its own.

Day one, you should download drivers from your component manufacturer's website. Especially GPU drivers.

Now on to your questions:

You shouldn't need to do much after you install Windows aside from of course installing your preferred programs ([here's](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome) a huge list of very useful tools to get you up and running.

This optional but Microsoft installs some bloatware on your machine (I think you can manually remove most of it in the latest Windows update, but still) so if you want to get rid of that I recommend using [Windows10Debloater](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater), and if you're worried about privacy and telemetry then use [O&O ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10).

About security: I personally don't use any antivirus program and rely on Windows Defender and generally trust myself to not click or run anything suspicious, but if you want to use an extra layer of security I recommend [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (the free version does the job but the pro version is 100% worth buying). You'll also want to use an adblocker like [Ublock Origin](https://www.ublock.org/) when using your preferred web browser (mine is [Brave Browser](https://brave.com)) to help further protect you and just remove annoying ads that clutter the internet nowadays.

Regarding maintenance, Windows handles most of it for you these days. The only things I can think of right now are manually doing the occasional virus scan (either with Malwarebytes or with Windows Defender), removing some junk files that are left behind every couple of months with Windows' Disk Cleaner tool.

Windows now has these big updates that happen twice a year (the last one was this May) and they are notorious for breaking things so whenever you're faced with one of those, make sure to wait at least a week or two before updating just to make sure you won't have an unnecessary headache.

Now, when it comes to defragmenting I can't give you a solid answer because I've been using an SSD for a while, but Windows will handle that for you (I think the tool is called Disk Optimization and you can choose how often it will optimize your hard drive).
