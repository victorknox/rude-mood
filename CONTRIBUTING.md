you can contribute to the project by helping us with the annotations which will be used to know the efficiency of existing classifiers or improving it. To contribute:

- Make sure to create an issue mentioning the details of the dataset you want to annotate
    Eg: I will be annotating the win_comments dataset numbered from 200-300
- Make sure to check issues and choose a dataset that does not overlap with any other issue
- The annotation is pretty simple: read and assign a politeness score for each comment. the politeness score can be {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. where -2 = very impolite, 0 = neutral and 2 = very polite.
