Can anyone help me?I just came back from Linux and I wanted to install windows again and I can’t install it because they are all partitions.What do I do?,"They say that windows can't be installed on this partition.
That's because of the partition table. (MBR or GPT)
(You select this partition table when you make the bootable USB)
If you made the windows 10 bootable USB using ""Rufus"" on a windows system, then there was a drop down menu to select the partition table.

I recommend UEFI + GPT options in the drop down (this is the latest and has no drawbacks)
The other option is BIOS + MBR 

No need to be confused these are just 2 drop down menus in the Rufus UI

The thing you need to remember is when you dual boot 2 OSs, both of them should have the same Partition table

Ie; GPT windows & GPT linux is possible
MBR windows & MBR linux is possible
But MBR windows & GPT linux is **not** possible (or vice versa)


The reason why you're getting this ""Windows can't be installed on this partition"" is because you're trying to install in the 3rd scenario I just mentioned

Solution:
Either delete all the partitions and do a fresh install
OR
Make sure the bootable pendrive you made has the same Partition table as the already installed OS.

Right now we don't know in which partition table (GPT or MBR) that you're existing linux install is installed in.

So just explicitly make the windows bootable pendrive again.
First take some other windows pc and boot into it, open Rufus make the bootable pendrive and select ""UEFI"" in one drop dowm menu and ""GPT"" in the other. Make the bootable pendrive and do the installation process again.

If you still get ""windows can't be installed on this partition""(that means the existing linux install is in MBR), repeat the above process but this time  select """"MBR"" instead of GPT from the drop down menu

And you're good to go :D

"This pops up when I'm trying to update windows, I had Virtual Box but I'm 100% sure I deleted it. I clicked om refresh and nothing is happening, help!?!??","Check the control panel. If there isn't an option to uninstall it from there, just manually delete the files left over. They should be either in ""C:\\Program Files\\VirtualBox"" or ""C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\...\\VirtualBox"". 

&#x200B;

Also, a ton of software uses VirtualBox to run VMs in the background. In that case, the VM installation would be inside that software's installation folder and deleting it would just result in that software not working as needed.

&#x200B;

If you are sure that none of your software uses virtualization and you see nothing in your ""C:\\Programs Files\\..."" resembling virtualbox, the next bet is to just delete the registry keys associated with the VirtualBox installation. There are free programs you can find that clean up your registry and should take care of this stuff for you. If you don't want to download more software, look for a tutorial on YT to delete software registry keys.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"So I use both Windows and Linux, here's my 2 cents. I definitely prefer Linux but Windows is better for games and music production. I know about wifi problems in Linux... it can be a beast to get working right if you picked the wrong laptop.

If you are going to run Linux, get your support line in order first. I guarantee you there is a chat room that can help you for your specific distro. You are complaining about not having a support line, but you obviously haven't found the official community discord channel.

Linux hasn't really changed that much over time. Most of the command line tools are over 40 years old. If you learn how to use it, you'll be set for life. I know what it is like coming in as a beginner, and when I was a beginner, things were a lot harder. So I feel your pain. Windows, however, changes all the time. What I learned about Windows in college is now basically useless. So, I'd suggest you take a free online course on the bash command line because it's worth learning. If you learn it well enough you can make some good money as a Linux engineer.

When Windows breaks, the blue screen error messages are really unhelpful. Whereas with Linux it will typically give you a more verbose and helpful error. I'm not going to say this is a hard and fast rule, but Linux is definitely easier to troubleshoot overall.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I'm not going to argue this post is wrong, but I'll also say that the issues aren't entirely inherent to GNU/Linux as an OS. Windows gets the support it does from being practically a monopoly, and Apple from controlling every aspect of the OS and hardware.

Linux has neither of these, so we have to make do with whatever bone we're thrown from hardware companies who often do the barest minimum to support Linux - if they even bother.

\--

WiFi and scanner trouble - that's down to the hardware vendor not supplying drivers into the Linux Kernel. I won't admit it's not a problem, but it's not really the operating system at fault.

&#x200B;

>she goes to the download page (linux one ) and it needs you to put in  the name of your distro , your architecture (64 or 32 ) and the specific  version

So this partially down to a misunderstanding. For most software, you can get it from an 'app sstore' rather than navigating to a website. Only Windows behaves like this, whereas MacOS, iOS, Android and Linux use something akin to app stores. In this case Ubuntu does package an (admittedly outdated) version of Zoom.

~~Honestly I feel they should be packaging a Flatpak or even a Snap as an option, as these are distro-agnostic. It would be more or less like downloading an exe for Windows. A lot of software now does this, so as to why Zoom does not is a mystery.~~

Edit: It turns out is is available as a snap in the Ubuntu store, meaning it'll be the latest version used on Windows.

>If you have  old hardware that youd love to keep using,then by all means try out a  linux distro. But if you have modern hardware remember the grass is  greener on the other side.

Not quite true. Older hardware can be just as hard to support if there're no drivers made available for Linux, or any documentation to manually add support. On the other hand, we get support for the newest CPUs and GPUs within a week or so of launch. So more like ""If you're lucky and your computer manufacturer didn't go with shitty hardware vendors, you're fine.""

I've spent 2 hours trying to install a WiFi module for Linux before, it's not fun. Worst still the device was listed as 'supported' by Linux - in reality meaning you need to search the documentation to find the exact hardware ID of your model to find the exact driver version, download it and install via terminal.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"This is me answering your comments, not trying to win you back or tell you that you're wrong. Use whatever you want to use.

Chromebooks are Linux and selling great, most schools use them. I also set an old lady up with a gOS desktop a decade ago. She was installing random plugins on Windows even after I told her not to. Even after I set her as a normal user and told her to only use the password for legit updates. gOS was based on Ubuntu. She had zero issues after that, apart from occasionally dragging an icon off of the taskbar (Gnome2).

Not sure what was wrong with your WiFi, but I'd MUCH rather install from terminal and trusted repos than downloading random drivers from possibly sketchy sites, or install the one with bloat from Linksys or whatever.

""Runs on everything"" and ""Runs well with all hardware"" aren't the same thing.

Terminal is preferred because it's mostly desktop environment agnostic. I'm not familiar with every Debian variant, but ""sudo apt install (wifidrivers)"" should work on all with the same repos.

Why not setup a remote access program like TeamViewer to help gam gam? It's SAFER if she can't install random software easily tbh. I say this as someone who does tech support mostly for seniors.

Customer Support, I think Dell offers it if you buy a Linux machine from them. But it's free software, if you pay for support someone can give it.

Most people attack Windows because of its popularity. But RDP has had MASSIVE issues as of late, and Windows updates have required people to ""reboot 6-7 times"" if they lose their files in a borked upgrade.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I see a lot of this, and I just wanted to throw in a comment. Just to get this out of my way, I run Windows 10 on my desktop and Arch Linux on my laptop. I'm comfortable on the command line, but I prefer GUI tools when it makes thing legitimately easier, which is a lot of the time. I'm not going to bash Windows, but I am a Linux and BSD fan. That having been said...

You're absolutely right - Linux isn't a Windows replacement, and people that say it is should stop. It *is* better in certain use cases like running servers or coding, but for most people if you're happy with what you've got, there's absolutely no reason to change.

That having been said, I don't understand what people are doing with their Linux installs to make it so damn hard. I have a CLI-oriented distribution, and I don't *have* to use CLI unless I want to 9 times out of ten. Installing software is usually a breeze, and I can easily find answers in the documentation more often than not.

As for security, you should run with your comfort level. My Arch laptop is significantly more secure than your Windows box if all you're running is Windows Defender, but your setup is probably fine for you. It's probably fine for 75% of users. If you're not opening strange attachments or perusing a bunch of porn or darkweb sites, you're probably going to be fine. Personally, I'm not comfortable with the amount of information Microsoft wants from me, and I perfer to be able to peruse source code. *But that's me*.

I guess the main thing I want to get across with this long, rambling response is that I use Linux all the time, and I don't see most of the issues you're talking about. You know what I had to do to install Zoom on my laptop? I typed `yay -S zoom` into my terminal. If I had a GUI package manager, like the one that comes with Mint, Manjaro, or, yes, Ubuntu, it would be even easier.

There's no need for all the hate, is me point. I don't know what went wrong on your end, but it's not typical. But if you're happy with Windows, I'm not sure why you're installing Linux in the first place. I have it on my laptop because I prefer it for connecting to unfamiliar WiFi networks and a couple other things. I use Windows on my desktop because it's better for gaming and I don't connect it to networks that I don't admin.",4,windows,student_20,
No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I see that you have tried linux for some time which is good. For your network issue I guess you had to reinstall network manager, Ubuntu already has it. Also yes I accept with you that Linux is most like enthusiast OS. I really like it for doing machine learning .etc. But proprietary companies like Adobe treat Linux so badly that it's far from being mainstream for use in video editing because famous software like adobe Lightroom is unavailable. 

But what I don't accept with you are your comments on Terminal. It's very very useful thing and this is what defines linux - the user is the ruler if the user knows how to use the terminal. I usually use it and in windows I use windows powershell in place of terminal of linux. I would say it should be what it should be, OS only for those who would like to learn about computer. The statement that ""my grandma uses linux and she loves it"" is totally exaggerated. Ignore that thing. 

About your installation part I totally disagree. It's not always that case always. Until and unless you visit Github to install  certain program. I have this app called Simplenote from git hub there they provided with all the option of .deb, .rpm, .tar.gz .etc. with cpu architecture like x86\_64, 32 bit, aarch64 .etc. This I found rarely. 

But I use windows for now in my laptop because my laptop refuses to dual boot with linux. If I want to use Linux I will have to replace windows with linux. Also my crappy printer works perfectly fine with only windows. In linux even thought the drivers are there in Ubbuntu it would install but won't work, in fedora it would install and work but I really don't feel comfortable with fedora and in Arch it refused to even install saying it's only for Debian and Red hat based distro which was disappointing.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"Well I think the main problem with this hole thing is that users have been manipulated into doing things the way they are to be done in Windows. I mean Windows' unhealthy monopoly on the market conditioned users since the 90's into using their computer as Microsoft wants them to. And yes this is probably often contrary to how user may want to use their machines.

For me since I switched to GNU/Linux the question I had to ask changed from 'Can I do this?' to 'How do I do this?' because I know anything is possible here. I will agree with the point that there are some problems that still remain, notably the availability of commercial software is often simply not there. Yet I do not think this is really a problem with the environment, but more a leftover from Microsofts' monopoly. Also for most Programs there are alternatives you can use. (Maybe not Photoshop as GIMP is quit different)

On the support side I do not agree with you at all. There may not be any centralized support for your particular OS, but I never had any problems finding what I needed. Also in case you are the one who is trying to help, you have build-in tools that allow you to do this (ssh, you could event use it with GUI if you wanted to).

I think I will never understand the fear and hatred for the terminal. The concept is much simpler than any GUI, you tell the computer a command, it then does exactly that thing. I strongly dislike any 'smart' features where when I change something this somehow changes things in the background. Also if you are helping someone, giving them a text to type is simpler than telling them to 'click the blue button' when there may be more than one on the screen.

One thing GNU/Linux is particularly good in is everything concerning customization. Or are you able to create your own system-wide keyboard shortcuts without any third-party tools in Windows? How long would it take? I have a bunch of these set-up because they make my experience better and I can work faster. I think this point may be the reason these stories you talk about may not be as exaggerated as you think, as the system can be tuned to the grandma. Especially if they have a limited range of actions they need/want to perform.

As a last point I must say I do not believe that Windows or MacOS cater to the user. They cater to Tech-Support staff that still needs employment and does not want to change their ways. If you are a user and have a specific workflow, most of those can be accomplished just as well under GNU/Linux as under Windows. Windows as a platform is not user-friendly, it spies on its' users (MacOS, now does that as well since Big Sur), things also often do not work as expected.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"Hi!  I saw your post and wanted to give you a rational reply.

First off, let me state that I am an avid user of Linux based systems.  I have used them for over 2 decades.  I also am a Windows System Administrator for a large, globe-spanning corporation.

&#x200B;

1. Linux for Grandmas and I switched to Linux and so should you!

The reason I seem to see more and more people advocating Linux to traditional non-Linux users has to do with Linux as a whole reaching a level of maturity that allows it to be used by anyone.  Another reason may have to do with most daily tasks can be completed in a web browser and doesn't require complicated, incompatible software.

A third reason may have to do with the fact that Windows now is selling you out by tracking you (via your Advertisers ID) from within the operating system itself.  You can opt-out of it somewhat, but it's always there.

Now, all my grandmas have passed away so I cant foist Linux upon them... and my mother is very set in her Windows ways... but my own family uses Linux.  Apart from typical ""I want ABC app"" and it not being available for Linux, there has been no issues.

&#x200B;

2. The terminal

I understand your argument but it isn't really valid.  Let me explain.  The terminal is heavily used in Linux because it is the easiest way to reliably get to configuration files.  In your example, the Windows equivalent would be to fire up the Registry Editor and change a bunch of database-y like settings.  The registry editor is very much like the terminal in that you're opening files and changing values.

On another note, the terminal is also an integral part of doing anything in any operating system.  macOS has a terminal, all Linux distributions have a terminal... and Windows just rolled out its brand new terminal program.  Microsoft also created PowerShell because they realise just how powerful the terminal is.  A lot of their GUI programs just run on PowerShell commands in the background now... the biggest example I can think of is Microsoft Exchange Server.

&#x200B;

3. Linux runs on everything

The truth of the matter is that Linux \*does\* run on everything, but that doesn't mean it has to run \*well\*.  You can find Linux in toasters, cars, sprinkler systems, refrigerators, eReaders, etc.

With desktop and laptop computers, the problem isn't that Linux doesn't run on them it's that some of the underlying hardware doesn't come with Linux drivers.  This is the bane of anyone who uses Linux on computers.  

These driver issues come about because a lot of these companies only cater to Windows users, simply because it's the biggest subset of computer users.  Most specialised drivers are reverse-engineered by other enthusiasts because they want to use their hardware with Linux, but couldn't.

If hardware manufacturers provided drivers to Linux as they do for Windows, then this problem would cease to exist.  Things have improved immensely, but there still is a ways to go.

&#x200B;

4. Linux breaks / No support

This is a valid argument, but like most things... you get what you pay for.

You have a computer with no operating system.  It's pretty useless at this point.  Now if you want Windows, you need a license.  Office? a license, Adobe? a license, most any other software? a license.  Part of buying a license is buying a limited amount of warranty and support... but not a lot.  If you have to call up and need major support, it'll cost you at an hourly rate.

Now with most Linux systems, the price is free.  You download and install Ubuntu and have a fully functional computer, complete with an Office program and a huge selection of programs you can install, all at no cost to you.  Are all of them top-notch? No.  A lot of these programs are labours of love, and the developers have jobs elsewhere that pays their bills.  

This means that if you want support, you have to go looking for it in forums and other community-driven places.  There are companies that offer tech support though, so you do have options.

&#x200B;

5. Desktop Linux hasn't matured

Your statement about having decades and not maturing alarmingly false.  Desktop Linux is a mature ecosystem with no less than three business-ready desktop environments to choose from.  The real problem has been the lack of adoption from companies who sell computers and software.  With no real financial backing by a company who needs to make money off of their operating system, there is no incentive for manufacturers to offer Linux to customers.

Things are changing though as more and more manufacturers offer Linux on their offerings.  The latest is business laptop maker Lenovo which just recently introduced Linux to a huge selection of laptops and desktops, pre-installed... and with support.

&#x200B;

6. Wrapping up the wrap-up

Windows and macOS have no choice but to cater to the user.  Users buy from their app store, make recommendations to others to buy from their app stores, track and sell your online travels and purchases, and in general are their cash-cow.  

Linux does not care if you like it or not.  If you want to use Linux then YOU will make Linux work for you, not the other way around.

With companies like Dell and Lenovo providing Linux right from the factory or companies like System76 and Libremwho design and sell computers made specifically for Linux, things are looking up.

You don't put the same expectations on Android phones to run iOS, or buy Lexus parts to put on a Ferarri... so why put the blame on Linux when it doesn't work perfectly on a Windows designed computer?

If you want Linux to run as intended, then use Linux certified hardware.",11,windows,fenixrf,
No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I agree with you that 'Linux' users shouldn't force Windows users to switch. Here's the catch, first, they are right about Linux runs on everything (not to be confused with the GNU OS or GNU/Linux, which includes Ubuntu etc.). Hell, Android, Chrome OS, top 500 supercomputers, your refrigerator, TV, or almost every IoT devices runs on the Linux kernel (again, not to be confused with the GNU/Linux OS). Second, speaking about the drivers, Windows has the edge (no pun intended) it is preinstalled in your device so of course everything should work. GNU/Linux OS is just a third party OS backed by the community and some corporate, it is not guaranteed to fully work with your device which already comes with Windows preinstalled, but most of the time, all necessary parts of your computer should work with GNU/Linux. There are GNU/Linux laptops sold by Dell and Lenovo which will not have any problem as that OS is designed to run on that device.

IMO, the open-source community has better technical support than commercial one, they are more supportive. Another thing, Zoom can be installed just by going to a store, searching “zoom”, pressing “install” button, and shwalla you have Zoom installed. No need to press that icon at the button and agree. And it is safer since you don't have to go to the zoom website, your grandma might download zoom from a shady website. Another thing, you might have confused “free” with “free of charge”. Both GNU/Linux and Linux are free/libre and free of charge. It means that you are free to do anything, there's no proprietary things or company controlling you. There's no company telling you that stop what you are doing, it's time to update.

TL;DR Linux is not what you think. GNU/Linux (like Ubuntu) is different from the Linux kernel. Linux almost runs on everything. Windows is designed to work wonderfully in your device since its hardware is designed for Windows. Zoom is as easy to install as installing a software in the play store. The meaning of 'Free' isn't what you think.

It not that linux relies on terminal so much because linux people think it's cooler or fancy, terminal is just straight up better than any gui ever was. Anything you do in gui you can do in terminal many times faster, it just takes a little bit of learning. 
> App installation process

Installing software on linux isn't necessarily as hard as you depict it. If you'd use Manjaro for example instead of Ubuntu you could use AUR and simply install anything through package manager (even simpler than on windows) and on top of that you get seamless and easy updates on any third party software installed this way.
> Compatibility

Honestly you've been just unlucky, compatibility on linux nowdays is really good most of the times. I have installed linux on multiple machines over the last few years and hadn't have a single issue.

Also you can't really put blame on OS if a hardware maker didn't bother to make a proper linux driver, I mean if that happens, it is an issue, it's just often not something an OS can do a lot about.",5,windows,ncpa_cpl,

No. Canonical with Ubuntu is about as close as we will get, but even Canonical has to deal with upstream changes that will break it's design.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I switched exclusively to Linux 13-14 years ago and haven't had the problems you mention. Four things, however, that may contribute to that... 1) I use ""mature"" (older) computers and 2) I use stable (not ""cutting edge"") distributions (for the last 11 years, Linux Mint),  3) I was never ""married"" to Microsoft applications, and 4) I don't play games. I went back and forth between Linux and Windows for about three or four years before finally making the ""plunge."" I finally realized that Linux was not Windows and that I would have to learn a little if I wanted to successfully use Linux. It didn't take long — about three weeks, but I had to stick to it. Now I'm extremely frustrated when I have to try to fix my wife's Windows 10 computer. It seems so convoluted to me. I compare learning Linux to learning how write with you left hand (or right hand if you're left-handed). It's frustrating because you know how to do it, your hand just doesn't have the coordination yet. You've forgotten how much time you put into learning how to write with your right-hand and expect the left-hand to immediately be able to do what the right hand does. People don't realize how much time they've invested into learning Windows.

At any rate, for what it's worth. My father (now 87 years old) was one of those folks who just took off with Linux and never had any trouble with it. But he uses the same vintage hardware I use and Linux Mint, so all the reasons that it ""just works"" for me are probably the same for him.  I also now check to ensure that the peripherals I buy will work with Linux ""out of box."" For example, if I buy an old Dell laptop, I'll either make sure it comes with an Intel WiFi card or pay $5 (or so) to buy one to replace the Broadcom card. The Broadcom can be made to work, but the Intel works ""out of box.""

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"Although I am in the same boat that I don't install linux for my non techie relatives, I think many people are applying the blame for setup issues on the wrong people. The reason that you need to sometimes do config to get everything working is linux is always a third class citizen to get drivers from hardware suppliers. It isn't that linux developers don't care about user experience (my laptop for example required 0 terminal commands to get everything working with kubuntu), but linux always faces an uphill battle with some hardware that the suppliers never tested with linux. If you hit a piece of hardware that has poor support for linux, then you will face some difficulties, and will require greater than average skill with computers to get it working.

This is the same though for windows. I recently hit a compatibility issue with some hardware, and had to do some digging in device manager, and manually finding and installing drivers to get it to work.

The thing is you rarely encounter these problems with windows, as computers are almost always sold with windows installed, and so are tested to make sure all the drivers are installed correctly.

I became disillusioned with Windows when XP debuted with 'Product Activation' which I didn't like.  I don't miss Windows at all and there is nothing that I can't do on Linux that I could do in Windows.  

Over the years, I've installed Linux on a multitude of laptops, desktops and servers without any major issues, including state of the art modern hardware of all types.  I've also used Linux with dozens of printers, scanners and other peripherals with little effort.  

Linux offers a wealth of desktop environments and an almost overwhelming abundance of free and open source software for every need.  Much like at Burger King...you can have it your way!  Its open nature allows for frequent innovations and rapid fixes for bugs.  I have never needed customer service because most Linux distros have thriving and vibrant communities of friendly users who are always willing to help troubleshoot issues.  I'm also the type of person who is willing to learn how to solve issues on my own through research and collaboration with other users instead of simply posting ""My system isn't working!  Help!!!""

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I'm a heavy power user and enthusiast myself and the thing is, Linux is more of a secondary tool for me when I need it. I will use it in a VM when I need the full deal, and when I need just a terminal to run something simple I use Windows Subsystem for Linux. Windows is easier to figure out (incl. the advanced things) and honestly the command prompt is easier to use than a Linux terminal (maybe this is just because before I used to used it more often in modern Windows I used to play a ton with DOS w/ Windows 3.1 and the underlying DOS on Win9x which all use basically the same commands as modern text-mode Windows NT 10.0 aka Windows 10). Another thing on Windows is that most of the advanced/geeky options can be accessed through the GUI and all you have to know is how to use said options and not how to waste time finding them through a terminal. Linux is open source, and somebody could and should take the good stuff from Windows and COMBINE it with Linux to make great OS for everyday use. Despite all of the downsides, Linux does have some pretty big uses. One notable things is the Tails distribution. It runs off a USB stick and lets you browse the internet anonymously with Tor without leaving any evidence on your computer or the boot USB stick. Love this stuff when I feel the need to be invisible from time to time. Sadly the WiFi support only works on my laptop's Intel 9560 adapter, but not on my gaming desktop's Realtek RTL8821CE which for some reason has ZERO Linux support. How did I fix this?

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"There isn’t customer support with linux, and while it runs on almost any machine it doesn’t support all devices (the manufacturer has to write a driver like they did for windows and many don’t deem it worth the effort). Some wifi bluetooth chipset vendors are a common pain and graphics cards often lag on support and updates. Software support is also a lot less common and the only big exception to this is Steam pushing to support gaming on linux and using a few tricks that attempt to port games over.

But with linux it’s often much easier to learn how everything works (if you actually want to) and if you ask for help online you’re more likely to get an explanation for what is broken and how to fix it than you are a canned response that has no relation to the issue at hand.

I’ve personally found linux to be far more reliable and have only ever broken it by uninstalling system components that use python. I’ve had to bang at windows every now and again to keep everything running smoothly.

While most things that can be done in the terminal have a graphical counterpart there are two issues.
First it’s often simpler to give a terminal command if you know what you’re doing. Copy paste this it will ask for your password vs open that click this, click that, click yes ... . The second is consistency or rather lack thereof, If you run windows I know you have notepad and with linux they can likely assume that pretty much every system has a vi or similar installation but linux is based very much on choice and while one person might have gedit installed by default another might have kate. Personally I use Linux Mint and as I recall the text editor is currently xed. As far as I know all of these, combined with the respective file managers, have some way of graphically opening a file with admin privileges and never opening the terminal. But the buttons to do so are often hidden away and again you sit with copy paste “sudo xed <filename>” because it’s far less effort to explain.

I wouldn’t recommend switching unless you were stuck with an unsupported windows version but if you are able to run both (on separate devices) or have some idea of what linux can and can’t do before you switch over it’s an option that’s out there.

Personally I got to using it because I had to use it for a programming course and liked the workspaces functionality a lot at the time (windows would later add “desktops”). Then my hard drive died a year later (I could still use it but it was slow and starting to give a whole bunch of other problems as a result) and the only machine in the house I could use while we got it replaced was an abandoned and unsupported vista laptop. Vista was still supported but not that version so I couldn’t update it and opening the antivirus for the first time in a few years was like watching paint dry. I downloaded ubuntu and linux mint on my slowly dying laptop and decided I liked Mint better because it had a windows 7/xp like feel to the desktop interface at the time and I felt more comfortable using it. That laptop still runs linux and I can use it with a few old HP printers that no longer have windows support.

What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/LInux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

I went out of my way to build a PC that would run linux comfortably. I avoided exotic hardware intentionally. I tried many distros before settlling down. Personally, I think Ubuntu is garbage for many of the reasons you described. 

The first thing an operating system should do besides drive core hardware is to provide a simple interface for adding and removing applications (any available application) The repository system as designed by most distros is a joke, having to connect random locations into a repository directory and scanning them repeatedly, and you have to pray that the repos don't die.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I would agree that linux is really not for the common user.  I kind of wish people would not sell it as a common user OS.

I play around with linux and often find myself using terminal and for me that is fine.  At this point that is what I expect.

But, that is what people should be told linux is.  Linux is a free and open source ""Project"".  If you figure out how to use terminal, Compile and configure txt files.  Then you will be fine.  But, you will have to know that you may be required to troubleshoot issues.

Which is why I at this point suggest manjaro over ubuntu or fedora based distros.  Because Manjaro has a very comprehensive Wiki.  Then when you use it you just assume you will be using terminal and you will be learning to troubleshoot.

Which is fine as a free and open source ""Project"".  But, people should not be told their grandma can run it.  Maybe as long as someone configured it for her and her grandson or son in law ( type of thing) could come over and help her if any problems occurred.",1,windows,Techdesciple,

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"I'm gonna go through some of the points that you made

First off, what you referred to as Linux is called GNU/Linux, of which Ubuntu is a distro, or flavour of, there are many other, but I suppose you don't care)

I don't agree of you about the terminal part. Sure, it's complicated at first, but once you get used to it, it's actually easier to use the terminal, because in Windows, you got your control panel, your settings app, your registries... and so on just to set your computer how you like it. Installing software is relatively easy on Linux too, the command line is self explanatory, you don't have to scour the internet for an install programs. Using the terminal, if you actually read and not just copy paste command lines you found online, you can actually understand your machine better. During my time with Ubuntu and Manjaro (I'll talk about it later), I really enjoyed using the terminal and really missed it when I eventually had to switch back.

Peripherals not working isn't really Linux's false, it's the manufactures that don't write software for it, but I get it, you want your stuff to work, and it's fair, I don't have anything to say about that.

OSes break, of course, when not used properly, but I'm just gonna say that Linux provide much more control and customisation than Windows or MacOS, from simple stuff like grub screen, to tiling window managers (there are ones for Windows and Mac, but they're either paid or quite limited compared to stuff like Xmonad or Qtile, FancyZones in Windows is fine, but it's buggy- I've raised several issues with Microsoft and I hope that they're working on it)

Linux, as I said, is not an OS per se, but it's not really aimed at desktop use either, I know that Linus Torvalds said that it was, but where Linux really shines is in the server business, where you can't afford to shut down your server just because Windows decided to crash or something.

You don't care about open source software, fair, because I really don't check the source code to my programs either, but someone is checking open source projects to make sure that they don't do something that's not wanted. That's the point, you don't have to, because there are people who do, and because of those people, open source projects can't do anything to you that you don't know about.

You are willing to trade freedom for convenient. That's a dangerous mindset, it gives companies, especially tech companies, too much power over you. Your information is more valuable that you'd think.

You are correct. You won't run into virus on Windows provided you have a sensible mind and don't press on every button you see or allow every program to run.

Your point about support is valid, but it's because, well, no company really own Linux, and to be honest I never had any luck with Windows support either, I actually found AskUbuntu to be quite useful.

You need to understand that the people told you to read the manual don't have the obligatory to answer your questions, they're just normal people, like you and me. Oh and the people who shit on beginners and Windows and Mac users? Those people suck.

All in all, I think you approached Linux with the wrong mindset, whether it's because of the videos you saw, or whatever. Microsoft and Apple write software with a particular approach in mind, where as Linux devs simply give you the tools to do what you want. You simply are not used to having such power over your system.

Now, if I'm such a Linux fanboy, why did I said ""during my time with Ubuntu and Manjaro""? Well, I understand and realised that there are benefits to both ways. In a Linux distro you can do anything, and I do mean anything, in the terminal, but I also enjoyed games, and like you, my gaming laptop doesn't have Linux drivers to control the lighting. I also have to collaborate using the MS Office Suite, and there are alternatives, but there's no point going a thousand miles just to get to where everyone started.

I use windows in a VM at work for some compatability with our systems. But linux also makes a lot of things MUCH easier. The terminal is an incredibly powerful tool if you know how to use it. Text manipulation, making automation with small bash scripts or just coding directly in the terminal. You don't need all sorts of different software to do simple stuff like formatting your text files or other tedious tasks.


I can spend 5 minutes and have a small script ready to read all images on a website and download those files to a folder. Doing that in windows you would download a plugin for your browser filled with features and stuff you do not need and the fiddle around with it until it works.

1 - Very few people understand Windows below the surface level. Most of the technical details of Windows are “black magic” even to your average paid IT Professional.

2 - Microsoft has been doing a good job lately with the OS, but many of their enterprise tools are merely functional.

3 - When things go wrong the best solution a lot of the time is a wipe-and- load or re-image. The actual problem is probably something that could be fixed in a short amount of time, if only the IT Pro tasked with the work knew actually knew the OS and those pesky commands or PowerShell one liners.

Linux is kind of gross on the desktop and will never be a serious user OS for serious companies. The fragmentation of Linux is not a strength that moves it towards wide spread adoption. The overall quality suffers by having too many  flavors of everything. Linux is still best at being a headless server and for things like Kubernetes where it keeps on rocking. I don’t think Linux has any rival in the server space and I love it there. 

Whether you like Apple or not, the objective fact is that macOS is the best general user desktop OS. From the elite hacker type coding up the next big app to grandma that just wants to scan some photos it usually “just works” on macOS.

>They tell you about  how linux runs  on everything but that certainly isnt the case, there are compatibility  gaps and telling people that it runs on everything is dangerous as  people will only realize that after the fact they've installed it. Its  not just the community even canonical the company that runs Ubuntu said  the same thing in their post.

The only incompatibility I ran into is the fingerprint reader on my laptop. Pretty much everything else has some kind of supports. Maybe you had problems with Nvidia but that's because Ubuntu decided to use nouveau which is as good as Windows' generic graphic driver.

>But what they don't tell you is that  linux breaks (All operating systems do ) and when it does you're gonna  be up the creek without a paddle, because theres no customer support  line that you can call.

The best option you  have are forum posts, but they've seen the same thing a million times  and they ask you to read the effing manual ( there are some great people  on the forums), but forum posts are not a substitute for customer  support. In the case of windows or mac you can at least call up a  relative that uses the OS and get their help. But with ubuntu you might  be out of luck.

There is a support line if you pay for it. Same as Windows. And Forums can provide solutions to most common problems if you bother to google or actually read the manual.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"As a complete newb on Linux, here's my two cents.

My first time using Linux was in early 2000s, in school. We had a single computer double booting Windows XP and Caixa Mágica (a distro made specifically for portuguese schools, but nobody was teaching on it anyway) and as a bonus for being the best students in our basic IT classes, me and two others got to play around with Linux. We were amazed. We also crashed it pretty quickly and the fun was over.

A few years later, I got a school computer (150€ computer for poor kids), a Toshiba brick running the worst OS in existance - windows vista. I upgraded it slowly and lasted a long time until my Masters but one day, Vista just didn't start. Sometimes started and it just clogged out all the amazing 3Gb of ram that I could run in my PC. Most days it just didn't start. I didn't have any booting CDs, I had nothing, so no chance at getting the PC back after days and days of trying.

So my only chance was going with something free/open , lightweight, that I could boot from a USB. So I used all my limited internet access to download a LiveUSB for Ubuntu, the first distro that came around in google. I was immediately sold. Other than being a techie fan, I had zero experience with programming (cofcof css and html don't count), with linux language, with terminals (other than a few bits and bops of cmd and forensic computing in windows). I actually still don't know much.But I was HYPED. For the first time, I could actually get multiple desktops (sure, I get it, windows 10, you also have it now, like 8 years later), I could get key shortcuts for everything imaginable, I could get my actual screen resolution on the computer, I still had access to Office and all the software from my Masters, I loved it. I had zero problems with Ubuntu, I loved the sideways default taskbar (which now I port to all my Windows computers), I started getting involved in more terminal stuff, learning commands, finding a lot of helpful resources in the community and solving all my few issues by copy pasting from forums.

&#x200B;

And also came a very unexpected pro point. When I got into computational chemistry, suddenly we had to use Linux in the school computers to run simulations and send it to the cluster server. Nobody knew how to even navigate around Linux and for some odd reason people can't see it as a regular OS and just use the bloody GUI, they just panic?? So some people tried to use their Macs and Windows to do the job; the simulator didn't work that well and also... how did they communicate with the cluster? On Linux was easy, run the terminal, one or two lines and you are in. Now, Mac and Windows required a frick ton of added software and then still use their command lines to even send stuff down the cluster. Everyone ended up mailing me their work and having me upload to the cluster and download the results. I was seriously flexing even virtually running Debian on my android tablet and getting my results from the cluster faster than everyone (it had a waitlist, so). Does using linux once just make you a tech wiz? No it doesn't, but somehow people just randomly freak out at Linux. Eventually we also came to use Red Hat in the labs and once again, people were dumbfounded and I still don't understand why. Is this what people feel when they shift between Iphones and Androids?

Later on I got a new computer. Microsoft 8.1 (ew). Before it got stolen, I got to learn Linux better, got into basic white-hacking and forensics, so Kali Linux was my go to. The more I delved into Linux, the more I liked it. Kali also found its way to my tablet once again.

Now, Win10 has a lot of features that I liked in Ubuntu. I have a corporation PC, where I can't even run a LiveUSB without setting off the freaking BitLocker (and admins aren't giving me the codes for it either way), so I'm stuck with Win10 and a Virtual Machine Kali. I now do a lot of cartography with massive datasets and it would be unthinkable to run QGIS inside a virtual machine (16Gb clearly ain't enough already on a Windows boot), but I think it would be much better on Linux... just not dual booting it. For once, installing packages on Windows for QGIS absolutely SUCKS, linux filesystem is faster which better for QGIS, the integration with python on linux takes so muuuuch trouble out of doing anything with QGIS...

Would I give my grandma a computer with Linux? Considering that she knows absolute 0 about computers and would just use a browser and a word editor, yes, I would!

Put Ubuntu or Mint in it, because I could fetch an older/slower machine and make it work more smoothly than any Windows ever could. Also, no nasty notifications that Win10 insists in shooting at you, no random restarts to install some background software that you didn't know you had laying around, no weird stuff where once change in a setting suddenly triggers cortana and three monsters out of hell, no losing internet because the adapter decided that it is time for an update that you need to manually accept even though you set all updates into automatic mode, no bugging you to get logged on. I mean, I could go on about windows pet peeves. (And HP Bloatware. Jesus christ, HP bloatware is the worst. Main thing I love about Linux - and also rooted android - not freaking bloatware, I just get the software that I WANT AND NEED, not 100 apps that I'll never use but keep shouting things at me in my screen... usually that they are not working, like Phonewise, or Sure Click).

Linux does what you ask of it, and only that. Ask naught, get naught. Ask crap, get crap. So for a complete, absolute begginer, I would still have them use Linux instead of Windows. No surprises after someone else sets the computer up for them.",1,windows,sora_imperial,
No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"With the Wi-Fi, I can't debate that too much, as that seems to be common with Ralink Wi-Fi adapters I think? I have a laptop from 2009, which I installed Ubuntu on, and the Wi-Fi works fine, versus my desktop PC from 2013, whose Wi-Fi works whenever I install Ubuntu, but shortly after refuses to ever work again no matter what. This is not a fault of Linux, this is a fault with the manufacturer of the Wi-Fi adapter. I agree that this is an unacceptable issue (unless you're using a desktop PC as you may as well just use ethernet), however the part about not being able to use a graphic settings program, and having to use the terminal is silly;

First of all, and I'm sure I'll repeat myself on this, Linux is not an operating system. Ubuntu is an OS, running on top of the Linux kernel. Windows runs on top of (iirc) the NT kernel. So, ""Linux"" will always have the terminal, and many tutorials on the web will teach you now to do things from the command line, not only because it's good to learn, but also because it's nearly universal. No matter what Linux based OS you have, there is a very high chance it is using a (popular) terminal. But not all Linux OS' will have graphical settings managers, and even if they do they may or may not be using different settings programs (most likely depending on what display manager they're using - Ubuntu for example, currently uses Gnome).

Can the command line be intimidating? Sure. Is it annoying to use? Depends on who you ask, but that's okay if it's not something you can get down with. While I enjoy being able to do anything with mere keypresses, you may not, in which case you should check out other Linux OSes, some of which are designed to be as simple to use as possible, others designed to imitate the look and feel of OSes like Windows and OS X.

And before I go any further, I'm not trying to convince you to use a Linux OS. If you don't like it, that's fine. Heck, I'm writing this post on Windows 10 right now, which I use every day. I'm considering switching to Linux full time, but I've been using Windows for nearly 2 decades, and it's a safe home for me. I'm just giving my two cents, mainly on some points that I disagree with.

I won't say too much on this point, but you mention about how you're kinda SOL when your Linux OS breaks. Now, you're not *wrong*. The kinds of people who can (easily) recover a severely messed up installation, probably aren't the kinds of people who have to do that often if ever. And while I've never had a Windows (**10!**) installation break down to the point of requiring reinstall (minus some hardware failure...), I do feel the need to ""refresh"" the computer every 8-12 months when things start to feel like they're bogging down.

(Also, you really shouldn't be surprised to not have a customer support line, when you're literally getting an OS for free, that doesn't have a team of developers hired by some multi-billion dollar company...)

Yes, Grandma probably would have trouble downloading software if it asked her what distro, version, and architecture she had. You wanna know why you don't have to do that with Windows? Because Windows is just one OS, vs the hundreds of different Linux OSes (distros)! Also, a crap ton of Windows software is just written for 32-bit (since it will still run on 64-bit), and targeted at - essentially - Windows 7, thus meaning it will run on the vast majority of current computers without requiring different software versions. You could indeed walk her through it over the phone. Or, you could do it for her. Or, if you want her to be able to do it herself, then hell, put a text file on her desktop that has that info, and tell her whenever she needs to know that stuff, that she can find it there. This problem won't occur with all software though, especially if you're using a distro like Ubuntu, which has it's own ""store"" (kinda like the Microsoft Store), where you can search for and download popular applications. Is Zoom in that store? I don't know, judging by the mention in the post, I'm going to assume it isn't. (Plus, considering how sketchy Zoom, and its company are, I'd be surprised if a company like Canonical endorsed it whatsoever.)

And, while this obviously doesn't happen on every site, it is possible for a site to autodetect your Distro, version, and Architecture, just from the browser alone, and then offer the correct download link (like many other sites already do with Windows/OS X).

> linux has had decades to become a fully matured desktop OS and at this point it just hasn't.

Yep, because Linux is not an OS. Is designed for all environments (not just Desktop), so the only requirement for a Linux OS is that it has some form of command line - aka, GUI not required.

If it is your opinion that Ubuntu hasn't ""become a fully matured desktop"", then fine I guess.

> windows is secure, if you dont do dumbshit on windows youll be fine windows defender is gonna take care of you

Fully agree with this. Windows Defender + Common Sense = all the security you should need on Windows. However, saying this implies that Linux isn't secure. Maybe you weren't trying to imply that, but if you were, then that's extremely debatable. I wouldn't call it flat out false, as (to my knowledge) Linux distros don't typically come with any kind of Anti virus/malware protection, but for the most part they really don't need to. In these cases, I believe the only thing needed is Common Sense. Some people think OS X can't get viruses, which is 100% false. It has been shown time and time again that they can. If you get a virus on OS X, there's near 100% chance you did it on purpose, or at least did something you *knew* you shouldn't have. While different, I still feel there's a similar situation with Linux OSes. Some people may tell you, you can't get a virus on Linux, which is even less true than it is with OS X, but it's still unlikely, just for different reasons.

> You can get windows for free now

Yes and no. You can go to Microsoft's site, and download a Windows 10 ISO, then install it to your hearts content, but it will be a non-activated copy of Windows. Can you run all the same software? Probably, I'm not aware of any limitations there. So, the main experience you'd have on Windows is free I suppose, but just so it's on the record, without activating Windows, you are locked out from certain features/settings, plus sometimes there's a watermark? You can bypass some of these restrictions by tweaking the registry, though that's not much better than copying/pasting random commands you see in forums into your terminal, so I wouldn't consider this a *good* thing.

Yeah, I can't really argue the point itself very much, because if you want to go install Windows 10, install Steam, and load up some games right now, you can definitely do it for free.

As for your final sentence(s), this is how I view the OS scene:
OS X is for people who aren't tech savvy, they just know what the want, and they want a device that will do it as simply as possible. *YES*, there are plenty of very tech savvy OS X users, but in general OS X is great for its simplicity, and ease-of-use. Where it lacks, is in the feature, and usability department. There are many things you aren't allowed to, or straight up cannot do on a Mac computer.

Linux OSes are (generally) for people who don't want any restrictions, who want to mess around to their heart's content, or who don't want a lot of the BS and bloat that come with the consumer OS choices. **YES**, there are plenty of Linux OSes that are built with similar goals in mind to OS X, and users to go along with them, like Elementary OS for example, but these OSes are outweighed by the others. Like, I wouldn't go out and recommend something like Arch to someone who's already not that comfortable with Linux, I'd go with something suited to them! And if they still don't like it, then I move on, and let them continue doing what they enjoy.

Windows to me is the middle ground. It leans more towards the Linux OS side than it does OS X (imo), but still essentially a middle ground. I would actually disagree that Windows works for the user - or at least, not nearly as much as OS X. I may enjoy Windows, but there are still times where it feels like it's giving me the middle finger, and making things more complicated than they need to be, where I don't get that feeling with OS X at all.

And your last part I might say the opposite. With old hardware, Linux OSes have the potential to give you a much better and more usable experience, but I've found it surprisingly hard to find the best OS for certain hardware. And the older you go, the less likely you are to find a distro that is still being supported. I have a laptop from 1998 that runs pretty badly now, and I'd love to put something like Ubuntu on it, but I obviously can't but Ubuntu 20.04 on it! (Not to mention it doesn't have a DVD drive, only a CD drive, so I couldn't even fit the Ubuntu ISO on a disc.) So instead, I have to try and hunt down a version that will run on such dated hardware, and hope I don't waste a CD with a version I can't even use. By the time I find one I can use, I'm sure I'd find that I can't do much on it because the package repositories are too old, and I can't get any good software on it.

I've had the best experience installing on newer hardware, or at least stuff <= 10 years old, but maybe I'm in the minority on that one.

As I wrote this, my point for writing this post became less and less clear, and I'm still not 100% sure what the point was, but I wrote so much that it seems a shame to discard it.

The right tools for the right job, I say. While Linux can be lighter, more secure, and free... only Windows that provide nearly (if not) universal compatibility with games and various hardware. I have yet to see a company that explicitly say that they will exclude Windows driver; that is straight up nuts.

In terms of ease of use... It is one of the ""weakness"" of Linux-based OSes: need a command line to run something and cannot be entirely ran on GUI like Windows. However, the degree of difficulty that is portrayed on using Linux is... greatly exaggerated IMHO. On some ""beginner"" friendly distros, for example Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Manjaro, everything can be done from the GUI, at least for the simplest of tasks and running the OS with your required programs such as GIMP etc. While the application that can be used may require alternatives to their Windows counterpart, they can be easily run and updated. Of course, it cannot reach W10 levels of GUI-usage... You will eventually need to dabble in CLI sooner or later in Linux... of which it unlocks one of the main advantage that Linux distros over Windows: customizability.

What I would tell you is that customization **is hands-down better in Linux distros than Windows**. As such, comes the other negative: it breaks down often. I suppose the ""often"" part is exaggerated, as an example someone like me, can be sometimes too trigger happy to use `sudo` in sensitive commands... I had to reinstall my Manjaro because I had deleted my shell file just because I had wanted to replace it with fish (the stock is **bash**). Even Ubuntu, which was the least customizable OS in Linux, had far more options for tweaks and tinkering compared to the Windows. In Linux distros, and speaking from my experience in Manjaro, you could even change the kernel. You don't see Windows can change the kernel... But that is because Windows do not need to...

Windows win a lot in hardware compatibility... Everything will run in Windows. Period. Dot. Zit. But not everything can run Windows... There is where Linux comes (and you have stated that correctly).

That being said, it boils down to choice. The reason that I would never uninstall Windows and dual-booting it with Manjaro distro is that I have specific use case for each OS; the former for gaming and editing work (because I have a specific software that runs on Windows 10... though if I feel lazy, I can just run a VM in Manjaro just fine) and the latter for writing work and having fun tinkering with the OS (eventually breaking it down... and had to reboot the thing on USB again... but it was entirely human error). Both OS had different advantages and disadvantages.

It's your PC, it's your business... I don't really get it with what's wrong with using Windows... You want privacy? You run everything on VM and get a portable USB with TailsOS on it. Now that is what you call privacy... unless there is a new method of surveillance that I might be unaware about.",1,windows,,

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"1. Linux has some ""issues"" with being user-friendly because of several things. First of all you all are teached since you are 5, how you do things on windows. (Use GUI and so on...), so the concept of using configuration-files is alien to you. Suppose you would teach a kid, since it is 5 (Well, let's say 8, because 5-year old often can't read), to only use configuration files. If it would have to use windows, using  a GUI for something like this would look alien to it. You can't say, one is better and one is worse. It's just a matter of education and how you are used to it (Although configuration files are superior and easier to use than GUIs imo).
2. The hardware issues are because of the manufacturers. It's NO issue of linux, it's the manufacturers' fault. 
3. Using a terminal is not outdated. Sorry, no offense, but this paragraph was completely wrong. A terminal is quite efficient. I'm currently doing my homework. I have 3 tabs in my terminal: One for nano with a latex file, one to compile the file and one with my mails with the assignments. On windows, I would have to open 3 windows and this would be quite shitty. I can use everything from this one window. Editing configuration files is often far better, especially if you don't have a GUI (installed/running). You can use, what you want.
4. Yes, it's true, that you normally have no customer support to call (Except, if you pay to Red Hat and similar). But linux has the one of the best, helpful and friendliest communities I ever met.  I could solve every problem with their help, I had. Yes, they often have higher requirements, but it is clearly stated. You shouldn't just dump ""FooBarBaz doesn't work<EndOfPost>"". No, you are expected to show, what you tried, what you expect, what really happens. It's just another philosophy. Forum posts are a good replacement for customer support calls (Calling somebody is my nightmare). You have every problem, anyone ever had, solved somewhere in the internet, be it stackexchange, reddit, mailing lists, github issues.... You often have dozens valid solutions for your problem.
5. Some linux distros are really mature, look onto debian, Fedora, ....
6. Windows is insecure. Just look onto all the malware. Wanna cry? Emotet? Yes, on the one hand a big part of malware is there, just because there are more users. But on the other hand, its reason is the obscurity of windows. For example, on my linux installation, I could say about every file, where it is from, what it is doing and what I can do with it. On windows? No, there are hundreds of thousands of files. Everywhere there, you could hide a virus and nobody would think of it, except it does something suspicious. Another reason is, that at the installation of windows, you first create an Admin-account, some users may not know this and EVERY program runs with the permissions of the user(==Admin rights). On the other hand a lot of mainstream distros don't even have sudo installed. You have to use su to start a root-shell. So the normal user has much less permissions on linux==>Less security risks.
7. Windows is not free. It is neither free as in free beer, as you have to pay the license nor it is free as in freedom, as it doesn't allow any of the prerequisites of free software.
8. Windows is a privacy nightmare. Nobody who says ""I care a bit about privacy"" should use Windows, except there are better reasons (Job). At least for me sacrificing the privacy for an OS is unimaginable.

>Wrapping up, Windows and Mac cater to the user, they work for the user,  where as with linux it expects the user to do all the work.

That's the great about linux, you have the total control. That's a pro, not a contra, even for normal people.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"This is the most ""absolute pile of garbage"" post I've ever come across in this sub. I've installed Linux on like 6 laptops ranging from 2009 to 2019 laptops and I've never had issues with Wifi. In fact, Windows 10 decides to randomly drop the connection and not showing any networks until I run the troubleshooter on one of my laptops which isn't fun when it happens all the time. Linux didn't suffer from that. Now I'm not saying that this problem doesn't exist but the fact that wifi works outta the box on all the different laptops from different OEMs and different time periods tells me that your situation is the exception rather than the rule. Blame your wifi adapter manufacturer for it.




Also, what's so extremely hard with reading a tutorial that tells you exactly what you should edit in the config files? I'm not a terminal elitist and I'll take a GUI any day of the week but if you're too lazy to add 3 lines to a config file then forget about it for good then yeah stay with Windows. To answer your next question, most tutorials use the terminal because unlike Windows, Linux is highly customizable and there are a bunch of DEs and WMs for it that have different GUIs (which is excellent because that gives you choice). It makes all the sense in the world for tutorials to give you terminal commands that you can just paste and hit enter on them rather than making you cycle through GUIs. It makes things way easier let alone quicker and trust me, the terminal won't bite you. 




Compatibility wise, I've never ran into problems, not even with Nvidia GPUs but I do know that some specialized peripherals don't work so you have a valid point. It's worth mentioning that this is not a Linux limitation but it's rather a lazy developer problem but that changes nothing.





""Linux is an enthusiast OS"" is another bullshit argument. It's a totally different OS so you shouldn't expect things to work exactly like Windows which is the mistake most people make.





Speaking of Linux breaking, you don't hear it mentioned because it never breaks on its own. I've run rolling release distros which are the most ""unstable"". My installation broke only once because I fucked up with something I had no clue about. It doesn't nuke itself with updates like Windows does. Also, do you know that you can make scheduled backups with Timeshift? And no, it isn't worthless like the system restore in Windows. It backs up everything including your program configs so when you nuke your installation by fucking around with stuff you don't know, it's as simple as booting into a live environment, run Timeshift and hit a button. There you go, your system and data are back just like before you fucked up. Is there something as easy to fix Windows when it breaks itself with updates? I'd love to know because I still run it for my games.





Let's get to installing programs. You tell me what's easier, cycling through websites to look for the executable to install it or just hitting the ""install"" button in your software center? Because the latter is how things work in Linux and I have no idea what you're talking about with program installations.





""Windows is secure""? I have no words. That said, you'll be mostly fine if you know which download button to hit in the webpage that you need to grab your executable from to install your programs.. assuming you're on the right webpage. Sure hitting a download button in your software center is way harder and less secure than cycling your through webpages that have 5 download buttons only one of which is real. /s





As for privacy, it's up to you. I switched to Linux because it works as expected. When I type something in search, I get what I'm looking for and not random Bing search results instead of the program I'm tryna launch. Privacy doesn't exist nowadays because there are a million other things tracking you than Windows.

**If you want to transition from Windows to Linux, I'd start with Linux** [**Mint**](https://linuxmint.com/). 

**Get Mint or Unbuntu if you're coming from macOS**. 

Mint does not send you to command line hardly at all. The ""guts"" of Mint are handled more like Windows, and it still has the ability to ""dive deeper"", but still has some restrictions/limitations to prevent people from bricking their machines.

**Windows** is great for people who want to use some functions of a computer and never want to worry or even think about how it works or why, and for people who are comfortable staying inside the box, and don't mind the pointless restrictions and rules meant to protect people like the lady who sued McDonald's for having hot coffee. ^(Microsoft does well including the demands of) *^(most)* ^(users inside ""the box""... but some of us want the) *^(more)* ^(that is outside the box, and want) *^(The Red Pill)*

**Linux** is great for curious people, people who prefer doing their own repairs when possible, people who value actually having the ability to do something, developers, people who fix issues and provide support for Windows users, control freaks, people requiring precision, and many others including people like me are tired of hearing something they paid for and own try to tell them something seemingly simple can't be done with it, or tell them where they can and can't go inside it or deny them access to directories or files like its not theirs, or are left wondering why ""Trusted Installer"" has far more access than the Admin and why TiWorker isn't chipping in or reimbursing me for the machine if they think they own it. ^(Also maybe for people who are annoyed by a machine that does all kinds of secret things in the background, like silently sending user data updates to Microsoft about every 30 seconds to 1 minute even with maxed out privacy settings... {To the point I decided to change the DNS record for all those telemetry packets to point to the proverbial trash and blocked the IP with an network firewall. Windows runs fine as a VM box, where it can be monitored and held accountable, and can be instantly restored to a perfect health snapshot if it catches something (since good malware injects itself into local backups and the back up partition to gain persistence, but VM cannot access snapshots) and that's the only place I want it to exist on any of my machines.})

Same with skype, Microsoft Teams and lots of other stuff. Also, it is very easy to forget how confusing and intimidating software installation is on Windows. There are countless different installers that often ask highly technical questions about where to install things, and uninstalling software is close to a joke. Keeping software up to date is either adhoc (the software checks for update when you run it, which is incredibly inconvenient: ""hi, thanks for starting me. But before we begin, let's do something else for five minutes"") ) or you end up with countless background update-checking processes. Linux and the Mac are in a different league when it comes to software management.

As for uninstalling: This is an operating system that has spawned a cottage industry of uninstallers.

It's very funny to hear someone pretending that windows configuration is the paragon. It's a mess of duplicate control panels and windows update is its own circle of hell. Grandma is not going to cope with it on her own. Microsoft keeps trying to push versions of Windows that fix this, but they break nearly all software, so no one uses them. When it comes to software management, Windows is beyond redemption.

If you want to give grandma a genuinely zero-maintenance machine, Windows is not the answer in a million years; that is a laughable claim. The answer is ChromeOS or an iPad or a mobile phone, which is the one computing device that consumers are at peace with. Remember how no one wanted to buy a Windows phone? Do you wonder why? The brand is consumer poison.

 Macs are pretty good, but there is nothing to touch a ChromeBook or an iPad (one of which is Linux, and the other Unix). 

Of course, you don't have to go far to find hardware which is a pain with linux. Just try connecting a high dpi screen and a standard dpi screen (which was Windows a few years ago). Nvidia cards can be a pain particularly in laptops. But Linux is very rewarding for power users and the next generation of developers. And it is actually never been easier to buy hardware which is guaranteed to work with Linux (see Thinkpads). 

But you do need to buy hardware that fits your preference to run Linux.

It won't work though if you have no network access. And how do you ""reinstall"" something? I don't know and I have set up quite many different Linux systems. Is there a reinstall feature at all or do I apt remove and apt install? Can I do that without network access? 

I'm sure there is some script or terminal magic I don't understand for that and there will be 10 guys with 20 solutions on the forums and that one guy with the actual easy way will be the hardest to find.  

This is bullshit.  
It's not a feature. It's a bug and I can feel OPs problem because I just recently had it too.  

I took one workstation here where I work to set it up with Debian so I have something to play with.  
Installation worked well. First thing I did was remove keyboard, mouse and monitor and put it in the storage room to be controlled through SSH. Started putty, everything worked for a bit, than the connection got lost. Cold restart. It booted up good, ssh into it, same issue some minutes later. After DAYS of googling and trying out different distros and hooking it up to a monitor again, I was left with a dozen theories and a hell lot of unnecessary knowledge about network drivers from people who actually were WRONG. Because THIS was the solution all the time: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1285451/broadcom-netxtreme-bcm5762-gigabit-ethernet-disconnects-after-a-while

I don't even know what that does and I don't give a fuck because it finally works and I don't want to hear anything about network devices ever in my life. 

This is completely fucked. And dangerous. It is even more dangerous than on Windows because you know it too: every new Linux enthusiast is throwing around those sudos like they're free candy. Many are getting sick of it and just do it all as root. Copy pasting stuff they don't understand. The harm you can cause that way has a much bigger variety than you could have even with an local Admin account on Windows these days. 

Yes I understand that the terminal is a nice feature and I don't want to take it away. It may remain there next to a **properly working UI**. Something where I can click all the things I need as a normal user. And none of the linux desktops has that and it probably won't have it ever because all those gosus have some aversion to UI design and usability because they think it's below them and they won't be able to show off and probably they even fear that someone will take their terminal away.

Actually Linux has about 10,000 different ways depending on which distro you use, which shell you use, and which GUI you use. That's kind of the problem. I can handle it, I even enjoy it at times, but I would never inflict it upon a ""normal"" user. It's an enthusiast OS, as OP said.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],">but having to use the terminal in 2020 is just not acceptable

You may think so, because Microsoft ditched their Command-based OS way back and all Windows users think that the Command Line is too old school. Windows has its own ways and Linux/UNIX has its own. The problem is that Windows users after using a GUI for most things for a long time, or using a GUI since they started computing, think that this is the fucking way of using a computer and all those people who use Command Prompts are nerds and dumbasses and way-too-old-school to belong in our community.

The terminal may seem like godsend to people who like using it, and sorcery to those who don't.

As for your comment that the terminal is difficult to use for an average user. I believe in you for this, but once you learn it, it becomes more easier than using a GUI.

zoom is on the app store. What are the chance your grandma is trying to install something super specialist? It's really not hard especially considering that if grandma hasn't been using computers for all this time instead of re-educating her from windows she's learning how to using linux. 

Linux does have customer support, you have to pay for them the same way you would with Microsoft. Maybe not, depending on which supportline you call. Also if your argument is that Microsoft having bad customer support is better than not having one at all, what you're admitting is that it is bad. 

>How is the Average person supposed to know that. I mean if you’re gonna search the internet for obscure commands you might as well go to their website and download the official EXE

Most sites have an install guide. If you go to a site, look for the linux version more often than not it'll tell you exactly how to install it. It really doesn't vary from distro to distro. If you're super enthusiast and you use a distro like Void, A) you probably already know how to do that anyway B) you can set up commands to auto install things. 

And back to your note on privacy, Linux doesn't collect data AT ALL. Linux has 1000s of people looking at and modifying the code. If someone tried to sneak a bug into it that could read users data it would be challenged immediately. Whereas Microsoft tells you during the install process for a os you most likely paid for that there will be ads and gives you the false option of whether or not you want to be tracked. It's got so much bullshit telemetry that you can never turn off it's insane. Linux is built to be more lightweight, there's never anything running in the background without you knowing about it.

If you don't want to spend 5 minutes inside a text editor for one time in your life then by all means, don't use Linux. If it doesn't fit you then it's pretty logical not to use it. You just can't shit on it because you don't like it and not because it's objectively bad. Many people will happily spend 5 minutes editing config files when they install it and have it work for good instead of dealing with an OS that you have zero control over it and installs stuff behind your back.





Guess what's another OS(es) that people move to all the time and are increasing im market share? Linux distros. I'm one of those people in case you say they don't exist.




Yeah, let's talk about the Microsoft Store and specifically Zoom. My sister wanted me to install Zoom on her laptop. I went to the MS Store, found it, hit the download button aaaand...it did nothing. After half an hour of hopeless troubleshooting I gave up and made a browser shortcut for her. Aside from these issues, the MS Store has only a handful of ""apps"". Let's try something most people use, Chrome. Can you find it on the MS Store? Nope. Can you find it on any PM in a Linux distro? Yup. I don't use Ubuntu myself specifically because of PPAs that you have to add every time you want to install something that isn't in the official Ubuntu repos. I use Pamac with Manjaro and everything is just there. You just hit the install button and it does everything for you. No need for terminal.




So you're telling me I see ads on FREE Windows program download pages because I pirate free programs? Okay. Linux doesn't lack productivity software. Libre Office became my first choice after trying it on Linux that I now install it on my Windows installations even though I have a MS Office key. Linux has no shortage of great software, you're only screwed if you use Adobe or MS Office and can't see yourself replacing them with the available FOSS alternatives that are just as powerful in which case you should probably stay away from Linux.





I'm not saying that everyone must use Linux because everyone has different needs and value certain aspects more than others. I'm an example of that. I have 2 SSDs in my laptop. I use Windows on one SSD for games where Linux isn't as good and use Linux on the other SSD for everything else because I find it way more reliable and easier to use.

No Linux Isn't a Windows replacement (for the vast majority of people) [Rant],"Hold up hold up.

I can really see what you are talking about when you say something like:

> Windows has the GUI, powershell, bash & the command prompt, so I guess that's four ways? 

Alright... so first, let me tell you that linux is essentially the unix system, but rewritten, and secondly, bash is a unix shell... it was written for unix, nowadays runs on both linux and unix, and I have never ever seen it on windows except for some community emulators... so yeah, you seem experienced...

Anyways, unix was created during ""the printer era"" when monitors did not exist and it was created looong before MS-DOS even existed, and something like graphical interface was unimaginable back then, so most of the great software was written for the command line interface. That is the reason why such great editors like Vi/Vim exist - Vi was written so that you wont have to move your hands from the keyboard... if you do not want to use it, you do not have to - you can use nano or some GUI editor which yes, sometimes may have problems with permissions, and if you cared a little, you could search for tutorials on internet and find out that you can just run most of the GUI editors from terminal with elevated permissions by writing sudo <program-name> <file-name> and boom, you get the permissions you need and this should work for most of the editors.

And powershell is literally just CMD with DLC... you can access registry and some other stuff with it which you can not do with CMD but in my opinion 2 different terminals are not a win... CMD might be dead soon because powershell has everything that CMD has + some extras.

> Actually Linux has about 10,000 different ways depending on which distro  you use, which shell you use, and which GUI you use. That's kind of the  problem. I can handle it, I even enjoy it at times, but I would never  inflict it upon a ""normal"" user. It's an enthusiast OS, as OP said. 

Terminal, optionally GUI... I can find two which is 9998 less than you named...

> Just about every distro has GUI support, but is it KDE, GNOME, XFCE, MATE, Unity or LXDE? 

Select the one which you like the best... does windows offer such customization or does it even allow you to use more than 1 dekstop environment? No. If you are going for a ""windows look"", then KDE is the best choice for you since it has a similar GUI to windows.

&#x200B;

Listen, if you have problem with using the terminal, then thats understandable, but you would not survive in the past and you are not going to survive in present if you are going to use Linux and even windows, because computers were told what to do using the terminal, and they are still being told how to do so this way because it is the most effective way - you can even make scripts using command line interface, and that's just one of the things that GUI lacks... CLI is just a lot more effective among many other benefits and that is the reason why people still love it, use it, and write more programs that make use of it, so being mad about having to use the CLI is just stupid.

If you wish to install a program, just go to the GUI store and click install if you really need to use and click your mouse instead of your keyboard, but honestly, for me typing for example `apt install firefox` (or chromium) is just a lot simpler than clicking it out in microsoft store or downloading it via some other browser.

Linux is a system which does require a little effort to make it work perfectly, but saying that ""linux requires the user to do all the work"" is just straight up dumb, and saying that:

> Never mind that you never need to edit text files just to configure an app and get it working in Windows in the first place. 

is even dumber. Sometimes, installing software on windows is a pain and sometimes I even give up because I do not know what is causing the problem - is it registry? Is it something in configuration? Have I not restarted for too long? Troubleshooter does not work (again) etc.

&#x200B;

You just have no chance of being as effective and versatile as if you used command line with any GUI. Sure, GUI dekstop software has its uses too, and in some cases it may even be better than CLI (for example for some tablets or touchscreens) but once you learn how to use the CLI, you are going to preffer it. You do not have to learn how to use every command which the CLI provides of course, the basics are a great start already.",-5,windows,Krelyshy,

Whenever I have to guide my siblings through software installation on Windows, I always have to answer the question ""Should I download the 64bit or the 32bit installer?"" I seriously doubt that they would know what kind of Linux distro they use if they were using Linux.   

> won't you choose it according to your distro like Ubuntu is debian based so you of coarse choose .Deb files.

Well, until 2 minutes ago, I didn't even know this one. Granted, I only use Debian on my vServer and haven't used Ubuntu in years. But I seriously doubt that this is widespread enough knowledge that people who don't even know which distro they're running would know this.

> In most web I encountered multi distro option and .Deb and .rpm types. It's just like .Exe file use.


No, not just like .exe file use. With Windows, unless you're downloading really old software or drivers, you usually get offered either a single exe or an exe for 32bit and 64bit each. In very rare cases, and mostly with software that is directed at IT professionals and not mainstream, you'll also get msi packages.

> My point is that for first timers it can be overwhelming to face wide variety of distro but still it will slowly become fun to use. This thing is totally user based its like if they want they will learn about it.

Spoiler alert: the vast majority of people (the sort this post is talking about)does not want to learn an OS. Even in general software development there's the saying that if users need to put in effort to learn your software, you're doing something wrong.

Of course solutions will be different, just like they will be different on MacOS and Windows. Has nothing to do with the difference between CLI and GUI though. In fact, for most things they are used for, CLI programs are more uniform across more OSes than GUI programs are, because there is usually a core set of utilities that do separate, more basic subtasks that you can chain together.

First, make sure their user account is a standard user and not an administrator. Have an account that they don't have the password for that has admin rights, so you can install things as needed.

I'm not aware of anything that notifies you or sends screenshots.

""Anydesk"" is a fantastic remote control program, simple to setup and completely invisible to him, and once you have configured it for unattended access he doesn't need to accept any prompts to allow the connection and it even works without him logged in as long as the machine is online.

Teamviewer works good too, but I've been moving away from it due to issues with it falsely accusing me of using it commercially, also it doesn't auto update and your version isn't close enough to the client it won't let you connect.

Next, reseat the processor, remove and readd ram.

On your spare machine create a Linux bootable thumb drive. Test that you see it as an option from your other machine and can boot it.

Work to try and not that thumb drive on the broken PC, legacy boot, legacy BIOS, not secure boot or uefi.

If the PC doesn't get to the loader something with the main board could be the cause.  

Remove the ram, see if you get a memory faulty beep code, if not, I'd suspect CPU needs another reseat.

Disconnect everything from the motherboard leave only fan for CPU, no hard drives, no cd or DVD, no usb front panel connections, as minimalist as possible, again with ram out trying force a beep code. 

If still nothing force clear your BIOS, there should be a pin to short or open near the battery.

My HP computer has high memory/ram usage,How much RAM do you have total?,16,windows,Entegy,
My HP computer has high memory/ram usage,"If you have 4gb, totally normal",12,windows,EmbarrassedActive4,
My HP computer has high memory/ram usage,"Believe it or not, this question has popped up time and time again on this sub. 

It’s normal behaviour from windows 10. There’s nothing to worry about. If you want a techie explanation, [read this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/application-management/svchost-service-refactoring).

As an overview:

-	The Services Host service (svchost) used to group logical groups of processes together. 
-	in Windows 10 1703, they rejigged it so each system process **runs in its own svchost** process on all systems with more than 3.5GB RAM installed. 
-	this adds many benefits such as increased system resilience, better responsiveness, increased security between system processes, better scalability, and better resource management. 
-	windows 10 will *always* prefer user applications and will attempt to shift anything unneeded over into the paging file to free up as much memory as possible for your applications.

Once Windows is installed via Bootcamp, you can access that partition in MacOS via Parellels in MacOS or boot to it if you need that performance.

You have to remember that the User Folder is a *property attached to* the folder the location is pointing to. When you moved the folder out of **C:\Users\**, the User Folder property was still attached to the location which was now empty, so it created a new folder.

https://i.imgur.com/fmQovyP.png

When you click OK it will automatically start moving all your files. Repeat that for *each* folder, even the ones you don't use. Because that way you have everything in one place. Hide the ones you don't use afterwards.

Your problem right now is probably that you moved it in the wrong way. The setting in the tab in the image I posted above is *leading*. So when you right-click the folder and cut and paste it to your new place, the setting will still say **C:\Users\YourName**, but because you moved the folder *out* of **C:\Users\**, Windows will recreate the folder because that setting calls for it. It is the leading one after all.

And, it's empty because it got created out of nothing. Meanwhile, the Desktop-view of Explorer shows whatever is in that folder, so that's why you didn't see your icons. You moved those to D:\ While the User Folder property was still pointing to C:\users

This approach may lead to it's own problems though, so it isn't 100% safe. But mostly it's ok.

windows settings help,"**XY problem**

The XY problem is a communication problem encountered in help desk and similar situations in which the real issue, X, of the person asking for help is obscured, because instead of asking directly about issue X, they ask how to solve a secondary issue, Y, which they believe will allow them to resolve issue X. However, resolving issue Y often does not resolve issue X, or is a poor way to resolve it, and the obscuring of the real issue and the introduction of the potentially strange secondary issue can lead to the person trying to help having unnecessary difficulties in communication and offering poor solutions.

The XY problem is commonly encountered in technical support or customer service environments where the end user has attempted to solve the problem on their own, and misunderstands the real nature of the problem, believing that their real problem X has already been solved, except for some small detail Y in their solution. The inability of the support personnel to resolve their real problem or to understand the nature of their enquiry may cause the end user to become frustrated. The situation can make itself clear if the end user asks about some seemingly inane detail which is disconnected from any useful end goal.

My metaphor about the car was stating that if someone can't be bothered to look up what registry files are and what they do, maybe they should take their computer to a computer repair shop, instead of trying to fix problems themselves. 

Relating back to the metaphor -

Driving a car = using a computer 

Knowledge of driving = the basics of how a computer works

You wouldn't drive a car without the knowledge on how to drive, or the basics of how they work. 

So why would you use a computer without the basic knowledge on how THEY work? 

To compare again;

You wouldn't fix a car engine on your own with no prior experience in mechanics, nor would you attempt the fix the body without knowledge of panel beating and spray painting.

So why would you try and fix a computer, without basic knowledge or prior experience on fixing them? 

Leave it to the professionals, or learn to do your own research on how to use applications like CCleaner safely. 
Stating that the application isn't safe to use because other people attempted to fix their own systems with no prior experience doesn't make it true. It comes down solely to user error.",1,windows,Jaydoos447,

PCem (short for PC Emulator) is an IBM PC emulator for Windows and Linux that specializes in running old operating systems and software that are designed for IBM PC compatibles. Originally developed as an IBM PC XT emulator, it later emulates other IBM PC compatible computers as well.

Unofficial builds of PCem are also available, such as 86Box, which includes a number of enhanced features, including SCSI and some new boards. Versions of PCem from v0.5 until v8 have been removed from the official webpage, due to the use of the MAME OPL2 and OPL3 emulation code from when it was not yet licensed under a GPL-compatible license.

... which implies that the data is gone.   No idea why files you believed were deleted are back and files you saved are gone, but I suspect you have had a non-recoverable fault, and after an OS upgrade it's probable that too much has been overwritten for a data recovery path to be effective.

Data loss after large Windows 10 update,"> Quick skim suggests that photoshop doesn't have auto-save/auto-recovery enabled by default

Not going to down-vote you, just letting you know that's incorrect. Implemented in Photoshop CS6 and later, it *is enabled by default*, and always has been. It's Auto recovery. A temporary file is written to every 5 minutes in user AppData/Roaming on Windows. If the application closes/crashes without prompting the user to save or discard, the recovery feature will kick in on next launch and load the file. I've personally been saved by this feature countless times over the years. If you wish, you can install Photoshop and find it is enabled by default without you having to change anything.

https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/auto-recover-files-in-photoshop/

For OP, CS6 auto recovery is less reliable. If the recovery feature didn't load the PSD, check the directory `AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [CS6|CC]\AutoRecover`, if no PSD is there, the data is gone.",3,windows,cbabbx,

So far I have attempted both the suggested commands with sfc responding with the statement that “Windows has found corrupt files but is unable to fix them” before pointing me towards an extremely lengthy log file.

Did you check services.msc and see if it is still in there? My laptop has had issues with the RST service before.

And final words would be that If it were my own computer, I would backup all my important files and do a clean install of the 1903 via USB. In most cases, this could be faster and more efficient and by best practices, all your data should be backed up anyway.

Please don't shoot the messenger. I'm only sharing what I personally would do. I always keep a backup of all of my data.",1,windows,xCONFLiCTiONx,
Help updating to Win10 1903,"Looks okay so far. So what happens is that the installer checks for the Intel RST driver by looking in the typical driver folder and scanning for specific file names. My laptop in particular does use RST. However despite me updating it to the latest version, the installer didn't let it work. It turns out that the installer was checking for a specific driver that Intel RST doesn't use (at least it doesn't use it on my computer). The screenshot you took proves that your computer has not loaded the driver , therefore meaning it doesn't need it to run. On my computer, it loaded iastoreac.sys while the installer was checking for **iastora.sys**. That single letter difference is crucial. The Intel RST drivers don't update that specific driver for some reason, causing the installer to see that it is still out of date despite going through the proper methods.

So here's what I did. **Please make a backup or restore point before you proceed**

1. Navigate to C://Windows/System32
2. In the toolbar, search for a driver titled **iastora.sys** 
3. Once Windows searches the System32 folder, locate iastor.sys
4. Rename it to iastor.bak
5. Do a reboot
6. Go to Windows update and restart the installation.

That's what worked for me. I did have Intel RST, but for some reason, the update direct from Intel did not touch the specific file the installer looked for. Since DriverView did not see that it was loaded into the system during use, I was 85% confident that renaming the file to something the installer wouldn't detect would not crash the system and let the installer run. And for my case, I was correct! Hopefully it works for you.",1,windows,weinerschnitzelboy,

Also, as previously noted, NT4 is ancient and connecting it to the internet is asking for trouble. I’d find other ways to play classic games like dosbox or virtualization.",2,windows,MotoJay,
Latest NT service pack will not install,"Pretty much, to summarize:   


1. Are you actually running some flavour of Windows NT? As in, not 2000/XP/Vista/7/8.x/10? If so, specify the version so we can help you better, and understand...2000, XP, and Vista, and soon 7 will be joining all versions of NT in the 'no longer supported' column and you may not get much useful help. 
2. Assuming you're running the latest version of NT still called NT, that is, Windows NT 4.0, you're using an OS that's been out of support for 15 years. Help for this OS will be mostly found by oldies who keep ancient hardware around as part of their test-labs for nostalgia purposes. 
3. As you can imagine, a 15 year out of support OS is a magnet for all the flaws discovered since it EoLed. **DO NOT CONNECT THIS MACHINE TO THE INTERNET!**   The only reason to keep it around is for a glimpse at what the world looked like back in the day. It's like having an old rotary dialed phone. Admire it, but don't expect that you will actually be able to **use** it. (At least, the phone won't be ROFLPWN3D the moment you plug it into the phone line!  XD)
4. Understand that you must run 1996 to 2004 era software for the best luck. Also, understand that back in those days, Windows NT was a workstation class operating system. It wasn't designed to run games, and while it could, it didn't run them well. Your BSOD on launching StarCraft may be behaviour as expected!
5. The Consumer Grade OSes that matched this OS are Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows ME. Starcraft may run better under those, assuming you're talking the original Starcraft instead of StarCraft II or Starcraft Remastered. 
6. Drivers will be a major headache. Again, you're on your own with this, as these drivers are themselves 15 to 20 years old. But try to find the latest drivers for all of your hardware that are compatible with Windows NT 4.0. If you expect any help at all in this subreddit, you should list all your devices and their current drivers. Some of us may be able to help you find the latest drivers. 
7. Understand that this computer is a **toy**. You will not be able to use it as a Daily Driver. In fact, modern smartphones will run rings around this thing, to say nothing of a modern PC. Unless you have an interest in taking a tour of the state of computers at the turn of the millennium, throw this thing away. It's worthless for any other purpose.

Help please! :(,"Thank you for the thorough play by play, that is very helpful. 

Yes you are absolutely looking at some sort of hardware issue. The only BIOS settings that could cause anything like this would be over/under volting your CPU or RAM to the point that they're unstable. That would have been done manually at some point in the past, so assuming you haven't changed the default voltages your best bet is probably component isolation. While you were in the BIOS, did you perhaps get a chance to check the temperatures? It could be that something is overheating, or that a temperature sensor is malfunctioning.

Component isolation is exactly what it sounds like. First disconnect all non essential hardware like hard drives/SSDs, optical drives, graphics card, and any other peripherals internal and external (e.g. Wifi cards, USB hubs, etc.). Leave only CPU, RAM, PSU, keyboard and mouse connected. If the problem still happens, take one sick of RAM out and retest. If it still happens, swap the sticks and retest.

After all of that, if the problem still happens, the issue is either with the motherboard, CPU, or PSU. If the problem doesn't occur at any stage during this testing, add hardware back one by one, retesting each time until the problem returns. At that point you'll know which component is causing the issue.

Also, if you haven't tried reseating the graphics card yet, it might be worth starting with that just in case it's something simple like that. Especially because the original errors Windows was reporting were related to your graphics card.",1,windows,aMockTie,
Help please! :(,I don’t have a Linux liveCD though...,2,windows,exquisityreddit,
Help please! :(,"My first guess is that your PSU  is faulty though the voltages seem to be OK. What peripheral devices do you have connected to your system ? Try to unplug everything that is not requited for your system to operate properly. For example leave only 1 RAM stick plugged and disconnect all of the system fans, if you have a DVD drive or additional HDD/SSD, disconnect that too and unplug every USB device beside your mouse and keyboard. Leave your system running for some time and see whats happening in this case. If it still fails try to take out your VGA too, you have Integrated Graphics available on your motherboard so you still can have video output without your NVIDIA card.

I think BIOS flash might fix your problem but to do that you must be sure that your system wont fail randomly. Some motherboards have second BIOS chip to recover from when the system fails but I don't know about ASRock, You can leave your PC on in BIOS screen to see whether it's crashing or not and then perform ""Instant Flash"" aka flashing new bios right from inside the bios ui:  Here is official guide for your motherboard [https://www.asrock.com/support/BIOSIG.asp?cat=BIOS8](https://www.asrock.com/support/BIOSIG.asp?cat=BIOS8)

Windows 10 does NOT allow both driver display models to be running concurrently. Ultimately, there was no solution for me: my Intel HD Graphics 4000 never received drivers to operate with my (at the time) new GTX 970, which operated on the 2.x WDDM model.

I think his point is that the reason your computer isn't working properly is because it's missing drivers.

Your WiFi drivers will be on that disc for sure if the wifi is built into the motherboard. Same if you're using integrated graphics and not a gpu. Fix the WiFi using the disc from the mobo and then Windows will likely update most other missing drivings (not necessarily all). It will more than likely fix the video on it's own once connected but if it doesn't go to your video cards manufactures website, look for a support or drivers option, look for your card in the list provided, and then download that driver.",4,windows,SilasDG,

I have a $1000 MS Nokia Windows Phone that was less than a year old before MS decided to stop doing Nokia Windows phones. The phone is useless due to poor design: it cannot be upgraded or have any apps due to IE6 being baked in.

Somewhere in my drawer of defunct tech I never really got any use out compared to cost is a Zune player.

MS should stick to operating system and Office and leave the other stuff to the community; they don't have to open source, just let devs access some parts of the OS to make more robust apps and add-ons. We have other choices now and people are wising up to corporate practises of trying to be all things to all people before selling out and it's not working anymore.

I have been so busy in my personal time that I haven’t really had any chance to hop on and take a look at any issues. I’m developing a game on the side, and I ended up developing burnout at work, resulting in having half of my workload removed from me. 

It was a project I started to learn powershell but lately I have had no time to hop onto github and look at the issues and resolve them. I’m incredibly sorry about your experience and I’ll do my best to dedicate some time to fix this issue. 

Truth be told, I really want to just rewrite the code itself and limit what it does. It’s gotten out of hand and with the other devs who are contributing to it now, it has gotten bloated and has become a complicated set of code to keep up to date. 

Revert Changes was meant to be more so to give the ability to revert the registry changes made - not the system apps being removed. I have poorly worded it. 

EDIT: Interestingly in my testing, I can’t seem to replicate the issue that you’re having where you have to wipe your system. Running “Revert Changes” appears to give me the windows applications back.

Yes, you need a Antivirus Program. But Microsoft integrated their own solution to Windows and it's pretty good. So no worries about that.

You just shouldn't run every file from the internet and always check software for their trust.

You don't need todo anything to make windows faster. Just use it like it comes out of the box. Only configure things in the settings app. Never download an optimization tool or something else.

And modern PCs are using ssds. You don't need to defregmant them. Only with old spinning hdds that no one should use anymore as primary hard disk. The need of defragmentation doesn't came from windows, it came from the hdd technique.

Windows is an out of the box experience. You just need to download drivers. But not as much as in the past years, because Windows can handle now much more on its own.

> Lots of people are warning me about viruses, and I haven't had to give much thought to security on a Mac.

Contrary to what you're told -- now-a-days you're equally as likely to get infected on Mac as you are on Windows, if you're a fool. There even was a recent post about it where some kid did an update and come to find out it was a Chrome Extension thing. Same goes with Windows. But, again, if you're competent -- you're probably safe.

Odds are you have broadband and, as such, have a router which will inherently give you a NAT firewall. On top of that Windows has a firewall now.

Now on to your questions:

You shouldn't need to do much after you install Windows aside from of course installing your preferred programs ([here's](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome) a huge list of very useful tools to get you up and running.

This optional but Microsoft installs some bloatware on your machine (I think you can manually remove most of it in the latest Windows update, but still) so if you want to get rid of that I recommend using [Windows10Debloater](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater), and if you're worried about privacy and telemetry then use [O&O ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10).

About security: I personally don't use any antivirus program and rely on Windows Defender and generally trust myself to not click or run anything suspicious, but if you want to use an extra layer of security I recommend [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (the free version does the job but the pro version is 100% worth buying). You'll also want to use an adblocker like [Ublock Origin](https://www.ublock.org/) when using your preferred web browser (mine is [Brave Browser](https://brave.com)) to help further protect you and just remove annoying ads that clutter the internet nowadays.

Regarding maintenance, Windows handles most of it for you these days. The only things I can think of right now are manually doing the occasional virus scan (either with Malwarebytes or with Windows Defender), removing some junk files that are left behind every couple of months with Windows' Disk Cleaner tool.

Windows now has these big updates that happen twice a year (the last one was this May) and they are notorious for breaking things so whenever you're faced with one of those, make sure to wait at least a week or two before updating just to make sure you won't have an unnecessary headache.

Now, when it comes to defragmenting I can't give you a solid answer because I've been using an SSD for a while, but Windows will handle that for you (I think the tool is called Disk Optimization and you can choose how often it will optimize your hard drive).

I am not an expert, just an average user but I hope this helped you in some way or another. Best of luck!",2,windows,,

One thing I didn’t see mentioned is you have the ability to turn off the updates ( more of a pause) so you don’t get surprised by having them download and install and you wake up to find a compatibility issue.",0,windows,no_penguins,

"Switching back to Windows, help me get up to speed","Windows Updates definitely break stuff all the time, regardless of how much people tinker with their system. From reassigning drive letters to deleting entire folders, 2 minutes of going around the Windows 10 subreddit or Microsoft's answers forum or even just whatever tech news outlet you can find would tell you that. And of course ShutUp10 and Windows10Debloater *can* break the system, but let me remind you that OP is not tech illiterate and those programs A) tell you that straight away and B) will not break the system in any way if you use the recommended options (in ShutUp10's case) or don't remove any critical programs (in Windows10Debloater's case). I've been using those for a long time and my OS was never hurt because of them, if anything it runs much smoother ever since.
