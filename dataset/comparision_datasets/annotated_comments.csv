Can anyone help me?I just came back from Linux and I wanted to install windows again and I canâ€™t install it because they are all partitions.What do I do?,"They say that windows can't be installed on this partition.
That's because of the partition table. (MBR or GPT)
(You select this partition table when you make the bootable USB)
If you made the windows 10 bootable USB using ""Rufus"" on a windows system, then there was a drop down menu to select the partition table.

I recommend UEFI + GPT options in the drop down (this is the latest and has no drawbacks)
The other option is BIOS + MBR 

No need to be confused these are just 2 drop down menus in the Rufus UI

The thing you need to remember is when you dual boot 2 OSs, both of them should have the same Partition table

Ie; GPT windows & GPT linux is possible
MBR windows & MBR linux is possible
But MBR windows & GPT linux is **not** possible (or vice versa)


The reason why you're getting this ""Windows can't be installed on this partition"" is because you're trying to install in the 3rd scenario I just mentioned

Solution:
Either delete all the partitions and do a fresh install
OR
Make sure the bootable pendrive you made has the same Partition table as the already installed OS.

Right now we don't know in which partition table (GPT or MBR) that you're existing linux install is installed in.

So just explicitly make the windows bootable pendrive again.
First take some other windows pc and boot into it, open Rufus make the bootable pendrive and select ""UEFI"" in one drop dowm menu and ""GPT"" in the other. Make the bootable pendrive and do the installation process again.

If you still get ""windows can't be installed on this partition""(that means the existing linux install is in MBR), repeat the above process but this time  select """"MBR"" instead of GPT from the drop down menu

And you're good to go :D

"This pops up when I'm trying to update windows, I had Virtual Box but I'm 100% sure I deleted it. I clicked om refresh and nothing is happening, help!?!??","Check the control panel. If there isn't an option to uninstall it from there, just manually delete the files left over. They should be either in ""C:\\Program Files\\VirtualBox"" or ""C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\...\\VirtualBox"". 

&#x200B;

Also, a ton of software uses VirtualBox to run VMs in the background. In that case, the VM installation would be inside that software's installation folder and deleting it would just result in that software not working as needed.

&#x200B;

If you are sure that none of your software uses virtualization and you see nothing in your ""C:\\Programs Files\\..."" resembling virtualbox, the next bet is to just delete the registry keys associated with the VirtualBox installation. There are free programs you can find that clean up your registry and should take care of this stuff for you. If you don't want to download more software, look for a tutorial on YT to delete software registry keys. It's a little risky and you could potentially ruin your Windows installation if you delete something you're not supposed to, so do this at your own risk.",2,windows,AlexMelillo,
